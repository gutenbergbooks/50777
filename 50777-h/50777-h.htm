<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />Why Beautiful Birds
are Killed</h2>

<p>What beautiful things birds are! Can you think
of any other creatures that are quite so beautiful?
I know you will say &ldquo;Butterflies,&rdquo; and perhaps it <i>is</i>
a race between the birds and the butterflies, but I
think the birds win it even here in England. Just
think of the Kingfisher, that bird that is like a little
live chip of the blue sky, flying about all by itself,
and doing just what it likes. The Sky-blue Butterfly
is like that too, I know, but then it is a much
smaller chip, and does not shine in the sun in such a
wonderful way as the Kingfisher does. Neither, I
think, does the Peacock-Butterfly, or the Red Admiral,
or the Painted Lady, or the Greater or Lesser Tortoise-shell;
and, besides, they none of them go so fast.
Yes, all those butterflies are beautiful, very, very
beautiful. But now, supposing they were all flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
about in a field that a river was winding through,
and, supposing you were sitting there too, amongst
the daisies and buttercups in the bright summer sunshine,
and looking at them, and supposing all at once
there was a little dancing dot of light far away down
the river, and that it came gleaming and gleaming
along, getting nearer and nearer and keeping just in
the middle all the time, till it passed you like a
sapphire sunbeam, like a star upon a bird's wings,
then I am sure you would look and look at it all the
time it was coming, and look and look after it all
the time it was going away, and when at last it was
quite gone you would sit wondering, forgetting
about the butterflies, and thinking only of that star-bird,
that little jewelly gem. But, perhaps, if you
were to see a <i>Purple Emperor</i> sweeping along&mdash;ah,
<i>he</i> is a <i>very</i> magnificent butterfly, is the purple emperor.
You can tell that from his name, but whether
he is <i>quite</i> so magnificent as a star-bird (for that is
what we will call the Kingfisher)&mdash;well, it is not so
easy to decide. The birds and the butterflies are
both beautiful, there is no doubt about that, only
this little book is about beautiful birds, and perhaps
afterwards there will be another one about beautiful
butterflies. That will be quite fair to both.</p>

<p>The birds, then! We will talk about them.
I am going to tell you about some of the most beau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>tiful
ones that there are, and to describe them to
you, so that you will know something about what
they are like. But perhaps you think that you
know that already because you have seen them, so
that <i>you</i> could tell <i>me</i> what they are like. There is
the star-bird that we have been talking about, and
then there is the Thrush and the Blackbird. What
two more beautiful birds could you see than they, as
they hop about over the lawn of your garden in the
early dewy morning? The Blackbird is all over of
such a dark, glossy, velvety black, and his bill is
such a lovely, deep, orangy gold. It would be difficult,
surely, to find a handsomer bird, but the Thrush,
with his lovely speckled breast, is just as handsome.
Then the Robin with <i>his</i> crimson breast, and his little
round ball of a body&mdash;what bird could be prettier?
Or the Chaffinch, or Greenfinch, or Linnet? Or the
Bullfinch, surely <i>he</i> is handsomer than all of them
(except the star-bird), with his beautiful mauve-peach-cherry-crimson
breast, and his coal-black head
and nice fat beak, and that pleasant, saucy look that
he has. Yes, <i>he</i> is the handsomest, unless&mdash;oh, just
fancy! we were actually leaving out the Goldfinch.
<i>He</i> has crimson on each side of his face, and a black
velvet cap on his head, whilst on both his wings he
has feathers of a beautiful, bright, golden yellow.
I think <i>he must</i> be the handsomest, unless it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
Brambling, who is dressed all in russet and gold.
And then there is the Yellow-Wagtail! Could one
think of a prettier little bird than he is&mdash;unless one
tried a good deal? To be a wagtail at all is something,
but to be not only a Wagtail but yellow all
over as well, <i>that does</i> make a pretty little bird!
And I daresay you have seen him running about on
your lawn, too, at the same time as the thrush and the
blackbird. And there is <i>another</i> bird, one that you
do not see running or hopping over your lawn, but
flying over it, sometimes far above it, when the sky
is blue and the insects are high in the air, sometimes
just skimming it when it is dull and cloudy and the
insects are flying low. You know what bird it is
I mean, now&mdash;the Swallow. I need not <i>say</i> how
beautiful <i>he</i> is.</p>

<p>So, as you have seen all these pretty birds, and a
good many others too&mdash;at least if you live in the
country and not in London&mdash;perhaps you think that
there cannot be many, or perhaps any, that are so
<i>very</i> much prettier. Ah, but do not be too sure
about that. You must never think that because
something is very beautiful there can be nothing
still more beautiful. <i>You</i> may not be able to imagine
anything more beautiful, but that may be only
because your imagination is not strong enough to do
it. It may be a very good imagination in its way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
better than mine perhaps, or a great many other
people's, but still it is not good enough. In fact
there is not one of us who has an imagination which
<i>is</i> good enough to do things like that. <i>We</i> could
never have imagined birds which are still more
beautiful than those we have been talking about.
Indeed we could never have imagined those that
we <i>have</i> been talking about. Only Dame Nature has
been able to imagine them both.</p>

<p><i>She</i> can imagine anything, and the funny thing is
that as she imagines it, there it is&mdash;just as if she had
cut it out with a pair of scissors. Perhaps she does
do that. She is a lady&mdash;<i>Dame</i> Nature, you know&mdash;so
she would know how to use a pair of scissors.
But what <i>her</i> scissors are like and how she uses them
and what sort of stuff it is that she cuts things out
of, those are things which nobody knows. Only, there
are the birds, not only the beautiful ones that you
have seen, but a very great many others which you
have never seen, and which are so very much more
beautiful than the ones you have, that if you were to
see those beside them, they would look quite&mdash;well
no, not ugly&mdash;thrushes and blackbirds and swallows
and robin-redbreasts could not look <i>that</i>&mdash;but insignificant&mdash;in
comparison.</p>

<p>Now it is about some of those birds&mdash;the very
beautiful birds of all, the most beautiful ones in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
whole world&mdash;that I am going to tell you; but all
the while I am telling you, you must remember that
they&mdash;these very beautiful birds&mdash;do not sing, whilst
<i>our</i> birds&mdash;the insignificant-looking ones&mdash;do. So
you must not think poorly of our birds because their
colours are plain or even dingy&mdash;I mean in comparison
with these other ones&mdash;for if they have not the great
beauty of plumage, they have the great beauty of song.
And perhaps you would not so very much mind growing
up plain, like a lark or a nightingale (which would
not be so very, very plain), if you could <i>sing</i> like a
lark or a nightingale&mdash;as perhaps one day you will.</p>

<p>Indeed, I sometimes wish that those very beautiful
birds were not quite so beautiful as they are. You
will think that a funny wish to have, but there is a
sensible reason for it, which I will explain to you.
Perhaps if they were not quite so beautiful, not quite
so many of them would be killed. For, strange as it
may seem to you&mdash;and I know it <i>will</i> seem strange&mdash;it
is just because the birds <i>are</i> beautiful that hundreds
and hundreds, yes, and thousands and thousands, of
them are being killed every day. Yes, it is quite true.
I wish it were not, but I am sorry to say it is.
People kill the birds <i>because</i> they are beautiful. But
is not that cruel? Yes, indeed it is, very, very cruel.
It is cruel for two reasons: first, because to kill them
gives them pain; and secondly, because their life is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
happy. Can anything be happier than the life of
a bird? Surely not. Only to fly, just think how
delightful that must be, and then to be always living
in green, leafy palaces under the bright, warm sun
and the blue sky. For I must tell you that these
birds we are going to talk about live where the trees
are always leafy, where the sun is always bright and
the sky always blue. So they are always happy.
Even if a bird <i>could</i> be unhappy in winter&mdash;which I
am not at all sure about&mdash;there is no winter there.
Now the happier any creature is the more cruel it is
to kill it and take that happiness away from it. I
am sure you will understand that. If you were
carrying a very heavy weight, which tired you and
made you stoop and gave you no pleasure at all, and
some one were to come and take it away from you,
you would not think that so very cruel. You would
have nothing now, it is true, but then all you <i>had</i> had
was that weight, which was so heavy and made you
stoop. But, now, if you were carrying a beautiful
bunch of flowers which smelt sweetly and weighed
just nothing at all, and some one were to take <i>that</i>
away, you would think <i>that</i> cruel, I am sure. A bird's
life is like that bunch of flowers. How cruel, then, it
must be to take it away from any bird. We should
think it very wrong if some one were to kill <i>us</i>. Yet it
is not <i>always</i> a bunch of flowers that <i>we</i> are carrying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>So, as it is cruel to kill the birds, and as they are
not nearly so beautiful when they are dead as they are
when they are alive, and as the world is full of
tender-hearted women to love them and plead for
them and to say, &ldquo;Do not kill them,&rdquo; perhaps you will
wonder why it is that they are killed. I will tell you
how it has come about. When Dame Nature had imagined
all her beautiful birds, and then cut them out of
that wonderful stuff of hers&mdash;the stuff of life&mdash;with
her marvellous pair of scissors, she said to her eldest
daughter&mdash;whose name is Truth&mdash;&ldquo;Now I will leave
them and go away for a little, for there are other
places where I must imagine things and cut them out
with my scissors.&rdquo; Truth said, &ldquo;Do not leave the
birds, for there are men in the world with hard hearts
and a film over their eyes. They will see the birds,
but not their beauty, because of the film, and they
will kill them because of their hearts, which are like
marble or rock or stone.&rdquo; &ldquo;They are, it is true,&rdquo;
said Dame Nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span> &ldquo;and indeed it was of some such
material that I cut them out. I had my reasons, but
you would never understand them, so I shall not tell
you what they were. But there are not only my
men in the world; there are my women too. I cut
<i>them</i> out of something very different. It was soft and
yielding, and that part that went to make the heart
was like water&mdash;like soft water. I made them, too,
to have influence over the men, and I put no film over
<i>their</i> eyes. <i>They</i> will see how beautiful my birds are,
and they will know that they are more beautiful alive
than dead. And because of this and their soft hearts
they will not kill them, and to the men they will say,
&lsquo;Do not kill them,&rsquo; and my beautiful birds will live.
Women will spare them because they have pity, and
men because women ask them to. And to make it
still more certain, see yonder on that hill sits the
Goddess of Pity. She has come from heaven to help
me, and has promised to stay till I return. It is from
her that pity goes into all those hearts that have it,
and because she is a goddess, she sends most of it
into the hearts of women. Have no fear, then, for
until the Goddess of Pity falls asleep my birds are
safe.&rdquo; &ldquo;But <i>may</i> she not fall asleep?&rdquo; said Truth.
But Dame Nature had hurried away with her scissors,
and was out of hearing.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone, there crept out of a
dark cave, where he had been hiding, an ugly little
mannikin, who hated Dame Nature and her daughter
Truth, and did everything he could to spite them
both. Their very names made him angry. He was
a demon, really, and ugly, as I say. But he did not
<i>look</i> ugly, because nobody saw him. All that people
saw when they looked at him was a suit of clothes,
and this suit of clothes was so well made and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
fashionable, and fitted him so well, that they always
thought the ugly demon inside it was just what he
ought to be. So, of course, as every one had different
ideas as to what he ought to be, he seemed different
to different people. One person looked at the
clothes, and thought him quite remarkable, another
one looked at them and thought him ordinary and
commonplace, and so on. Only every one was
pleased, because, whatever else he seemed, he always
seemed just what he ought to be. So, when two
people both found that he was that, they each of
them thought that he looked the same to the other.
Of course the clothes were enchanted, really, only nobody
knew it, and if any one had been told that it was
the clothes and not the demon inside them they were
looking at, he would not have believed it. It was
only Dame Nature and her daughter Truth who
could look at those clothes and see the little demon
inside them, just as he really was. That was why
he hated them, and never liked to hear their names.</p>

<p>This ugly little demon crept up to the Goddess of
Pity, who looked at the clothes and was not even
able to pity him; and, when he saw that he had her
good opinion, he began to repeat a sort of charm to
send her to sleep, for he knew that when once the
Goddess of Pity was asleep he might do whatever he
liked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>These were the words of the charm:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Fashion, fashion, fashion!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Give a little sneer.</div>
<div class="verse">Fashion, fashion, fashion!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Science makes it clear.</div>
<div class="verse">Fashion, fashion, fashion!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A bird is not a bat.</div>
<div class="verse">Fashion, fashion, fashion!</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Such a pretty hat!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Under the influence of this drowsy charm&mdash;which,
of course, had no meaning in it whatever&mdash;the Goddess
of Pity began to nod, and nodded and nodded
till, on the last line, she went fast asleep, with a pleased
smile on her face.</p>

<p>Then the wicked little demon took from one of
the pockets in the suit of clothes that charmed
everybody two little bottles that contained two
different sorts of powders, one hot like pepper,
and the other cold like ice, but both of them so
fine that they were quite invisible. He took a
pinch of the hot powder which was labelled &ldquo;Vanity,&rdquo;
and blew it upon the heads of all the women, and
the instant it touched them they all looked pleased,
and you could see that they were thinking only
of how they looked, though they <i>talked</i> in a <i>very</i>
different way. It was funny that they <i>all</i> looked
pleased, because a great many&mdash;in fact, most of
them&mdash;were plain, not pretty, and yet they looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
pleased too, as well as the others. But, you see,
it was all done by magic. Then from the other
little bottle, which was labelled &ldquo;Apathy,&rdquo; the
demon took a pinch of the cold powder and blew
it on the women's hearts, and as soon as it fell
on them they became frozen, so that all the pity
that had been in them before was frozen, too.
Frozen pity, you know, is of no good whatever.
You can no more be kind with it in that state
than you can bathe in frozen water. So now there
was nothing but vanity in the women's heads, and
no pity in their hearts, and as the Goddess of Pity
was fast asleep, it was not possible for any more to
be put into them until she woke up. Nobody could
tell when that would be. Gods and goddesses sometimes
sleep for a long time, and very soundly. Besides,
you know, this was a charmed sleep.</p>

<p>So, now, what happened after the wicked little
demon had behaved in this wicked way? Why,
the women whose hearts he had frozen began to
kill the poor, beautiful birds, those birds that Dame
Nature loved so, and had taken such pains to keep
alive. I do not mean that they killed them themselves
with their own hands. No, they did not do
that, for they had not enough time to go to the
countries where the beautiful birds lived, which
were often a long way off as well as being very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
unhealthy. You see they were wanted at home,
and so to have gone away from home into unhealthy
countries to kill birds would have been
<i>selfish</i>, and one should never be that. So instead
of killing them themselves the women sent
men to kill them for them, for <i>they</i> could be spared
much better, and if they should not come back they
would not be nearly so much missed. And the
women said to the men, &ldquo;Kill the birds and tear off
their wings, their tails, their bright breasts and
heads to sew into our hats or onto the sleeves and
collars of our gowns and mantles. Kill them and
bring them to us, that you may think us even more
lovely than you have done before, when you compare
our beauty with theirs and find that ours is the
greater. Let us shine down the birds, for they are
conceited and think themselves our rivals. Then
kill them. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill them.&rdquo; Then
the men, whose hearts had always been hard, and over
whose eyes there was a film, went forth into the
world and began to kill the poor, beautiful birds
wherever they could find them. Everywhere the
earth was stained with their blood, and the air thick
with floating feathers that had been torn from their
poor, wounded bodies. It was full, too, of their
frightened cries, and of the wails of their starving young
ones for the parents who were dead and could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
feed them any more. For it is just at the time
when the birds lay their eggs and rear their young
ones that their plumage is most beautiful&mdash;most
exquisitely beautiful&mdash;and it was just this most
<i>exquisitely</i> beautiful plumage that the women, whose
hearts the wicked little demon had frozen, wanted
to put into their hats. They knew that to get it
the young fledgling birds must starve in their nests.
But they did not mind that now, their hearts were
frozen and the Goddess of Pity was asleep.</p>

<p>So the birds were killed, and the lovely, painted
feathers that had lighted up whole forests or made a
country beautiful, were pressed close together into dark
ugly boxes&mdash;or things like boxes&mdash;called &ldquo;crates&rdquo; (large
it is true, but not <i>quite</i> so large as a forest or a country),
and then brought over the seas in ships, to dark, ugly
houses, where they were taken out and flung in a
great heap on the floor. Soon they were sewn into
hats which were set out in the windows of milliners'
shops for the women with the frozen hearts to buy.
You may see such hats now, any time you walk about
the streets of London&mdash;or of Paris or Vienna, if you
go there&mdash;for the Goddess of Pity is still sleeping,
she has not woken up yet. There you will see
them, and outside the window, looking at them&mdash;sometimes
in a great crowd&mdash;you will see those poor
women that the demon has treated so badly. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
they stand, looking and looking, ravenous, hungry&mdash;you
would almost say they were&mdash;longing to buy
them, even though they have new ones of the same
sort on their head. Ah, if they could see those
birds as they looked when they were shot, before
they were dressed and cleaned and made to look so
smart and fashionable! If they could see them
with the blood-stains upon them, the wet, warm
drops running down over the bright breasts&mdash;perhaps
onto the little ones underneath them&mdash;the
poor, broken wings dragging over the ground and
trying to rise into the air, through which they had
once flown so easily, the flapping, the struggling!
If they could see all this, and much more that had
been done&mdash;that <i>had</i> to be done&mdash;before there was
that nice, gay, elegant shop-window for them to
look into, would it not be different then, would
not the vain heads begin to think a little and the
frozen hearts to melt? No, I do not think so,
because of the ugly little demon in the correct suit
of clothes. They would look in at the window and
go in at the door still, and&mdash;shall I tell you something?&mdash;it
would be the same, just the same, if all
those bright feathers in every one of the hats had
been stripped, not from the birds' but from the
<i>angels'</i> wings. Those who could wear the one could
wear the other, and if angels were to come down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
here I should not wonder if angel-hats were to get
to be quite the fashion. Only first, of course, angels
would <i>have</i> to come down here. I do not think
they are so <i>very</i> likely to.</p>

<p>And the worst of it is that not only the <i>pretty</i>
women wear the beautiful birds in their hats, but the
plain ones do too, which makes so many more of
them to be killed. If it was <i>only</i> the pretty women
who wore them it would not be quite so bad, but
the wicked little demon was much too clever to
arrange it like that. He did not wish any of the
birds to escape, and I cannot tell you how many
<i>millions</i> of them <i>would</i> escape if only the pretty
women were to wear their feathers.</p>

<p>But now, how are the birds to be saved&mdash;for <i>we</i>
want them <i>all</i> to escape&mdash;and how are the women to
be saved? That is another thing. You know it is
not <i>their</i> fault. They were kind and pitiful till the
wicked little demon blew his powder into their
hearts. It is <i>his</i> fault. You may be angry with
<i>him</i> as much as you like, but you must not think of
being angry with the women. Indeed, you should
be sorry for them, more even than for the birds, for
it is much worse to be a woman with a frozen heart
than to be a bird and be shot. Oh, poor, frozen-hearted
women, who <i>would</i> be so kind and so pitiful
if only they were allowed to be, if only the wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
little demon would go away, and the Goddess of
Pity would wake up!</p>

<p>Then is there no way of saving them both, the
poor birds and the poor women? Yes, there is a way,
and it is you&mdash;the children&mdash;who are to find it out.
Listen. It is so simple. All you have to do is to ask
these women (these <i>poor</i> women) <i>not</i> to wear the hats
that have feathers, that have birds' lives in them, and
they will not do so any more. They will listen to
you. There is nobody else they would listen to, but
they will to you&mdash;the children. Perhaps you think
that funny. Listen and I will explain it. When
the wicked little demon blew his powder called
&ldquo;Apathy&rdquo; into the hearts of the women, it froze
them all up, as I have told you, but there was just
one little spot in every one of their hearts that it
was not able to freeze. That was the spot called
Motherly Love, which every woman has in her heart,
and which is the softest spot of all, if only a little
child presses it&mdash;and especially if it is her own little
child. So I want you&mdash;the little children who read
this little book&mdash;to press that spot and to save the
birds from being killed. Nobody can do it but you,
nobody even can find that spot except you, but
you will find it directly. And you are to press it in
this way. Throw, each one of you, your arms
round your mother's neck, kiss her and ask her not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
to kill the birds, not to wear the hats that make the
birds be killed. And if you do that and really mean
what you say, if you are really sorry for the birds and
have real tears in your eyes (or at least in your hearts),
then your mother will do as you have asked her, for
you will have pressed that spot, that soft spot, that spot
that even the wicked little demon, try as he might,
could not freeze, could not make hard. And as you
press it, the whole heart that has been frozen will become
warm again, and the powder of the demon will
go out of it, and the Goddess of Pity will wake up.
You will do this, will you not? It is only asking,
and what can be easier than to ask something of your
mother? But you must make her promise. Never,
never leave off asking her till you have got her to
promise.</p>

<p>And if some of you have mothers who do not kill
the birds, who do not wear the hats that have birds'
lives sewn into them, well it will do them no harm to
promise too. Then they never <i>will</i> wear them, and
if they should never mean to wear them, they will be
all the more ready to promise not to. Only in that
case you might put your arms round the neck of
some other woman that you have seen wearing those
hats and kiss <i>her</i> and ask <i>her</i> to promise. And she
will, you will have touched that spot because you are
a little child, even though you are not her own little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
child. Perhaps you will remind her of a little child
that was hers once.</p>

<p>Now I am going to tell you about some of the
most beautiful birds that there are in the world, but
you must remember that they are being killed so
fast every day that, unless you get that promise from
your mother very quickly, there will soon be no more
of them left; as soon as she promises it will be all
right, for of course it will not be only <i>your</i> mother
who will have promised, but the mother of every
other little girl all over the country, and as the birds
were only being killed to put into their hats, they will
be let alone now, for now no more hats like that will
be wanted. No one will wear hats that have birds'
lives sewn into them, any more.</p>

<p>So the beautiful birds will go on living and flying
about in the world and making <i>it</i> beautiful, too.
You will have saved them&mdash;<i>you</i> the children will have
saved them&mdash;and no grown-up person will have done
<i>anything</i> to be more proud about. I daresay a grown-up
person <i>would</i> be more proud about what he had
done, even if it was nothing very particular; but <i>that</i>
is another matter.</p>

<p>Now we will begin, and as we come to one bird
after another, you shall make your mother promise
not to wear it in her hat.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
Birds of Paradise</h2>


<p>First I will tell you about the Birds of Paradise.
You have heard of them perhaps, and how beautiful
they are, but you may have thought that birds with
a name like that did not live here at all. For the
Emperor of China lives in China, and if the Emperor
of China lives in China, the Birds of Paradise ought,
one would think, to live in Paradise. But that is
not the case&mdash;not now at any rate. They live a very
long way off, it is true, right over at the other side
of the world, but it is not quite so far off as Paradise is.
No, it cannot be there that they live, because if
you were to leave England in a ship and sail always
in the right direction, you would come at last to the
very place, instead of coming right round to England
again, which is what you would do if you were to sail
for Paradise&mdash;for you know, of course, that the earth
is round. But why, then, are they called Birds of
Paradise if they live here on the earth? Well, there
are two ways of explaining it. I will tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
first one and then the other, and you can choose
the way you like best. The first way is this.</p>

<p>A long time ago&mdash;but long after the little demon
had crept out of his cave&mdash;the early Portuguese
voyagers (whom your mother will tell you about),
when they came to the Moluccas to get spices, were
shown the dried skins of beautiful birds which were
called by the natives &ldquo;Manuk dewata,&rdquo; which means
&ldquo;God's birds.&rdquo; There were no wings or feet to the
skins, and the natives told the Portuguese that these
birds had never had any, but that they lived always in
the air, never coming down to settle on the earth, and
keeping themselves all the while turned towards the sun.
One would have thought they must have wanted
wings, at any rate, to be always in the air, but that is
what the natives said. So the Portuguese, who did
not quite know what to make of it, called them
&ldquo;Passaros de Sol,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Sun-birds&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Birds-of-the-Sun,&rdquo; because of their always turning
towards him. Some time after that, a learned Dutchman
who wrote in Latin (just think!), called these
birds &ldquo;Aves Paradisei&rdquo;&mdash;Paradise Birds or Birds of
Paradise&mdash;and he told every one that they had never
been seen alive by anybody, but only after they had
fallen down dead out of the clouds, when they were
picked up without wings or feet, and still lying with
their heads towards the sun in the way they had fallen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
So, after that these wonderful birds were always
called &ldquo;Birds of Paradise.&rdquo; That is one way of explaining
how they got their names, but the other
way, and perhaps you will think it a <i>little</i> more
probable, is this.</p>

<p>Once the Birds of Paradise were really Birds of
Paradise, for they lived there and were ever so much
more beautiful than they are now, though perhaps,
if you were to see them flying about in their native
forests, you would hardly believe that possible. That
is because you cannot imagine <i>how</i> beautiful <i>real</i> Birds
of Paradise are, for these Birds of Paradise were not
more beautiful than the other ones that lived there.
All were as beautiful as each other though in different
ways, and it was just that which made these Birds of
Paradise discontented. &ldquo;If we go down to earth,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;the birds of all the world will do homage
to us on account of our superior beauty, for there will
be none to equal us. So we shall reign over them
and be their King. Here we are only like all the
others. None of them fly to the tree on which we
are sitting to do us homage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not be foolish,&rdquo;
said the tree (for in Paradise trees and all can speak).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
&ldquo;The homage which you desire you would soon
weary of, and the beauty which you enjoy here would,
on earth, be only a pain to you, for it would remind
you of the Paradise you had left but could
never enter again. For those who once leave Paradise
can never more return to it. Therefore be wise and
stay, for if you go you will repent, but then it will be
too late.&rdquo; And all the birds around said, &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; and
then they raised their voices, which were lovelier than
you can imagine, in a song of joy&mdash;of joy that they
were in Paradise and not on earth. And the Birds of
Paradise sang too, their voices were as sweet as any,
but they had envy and discontent in their hearts.
&ldquo;Our singing cannot be surpassed, it is true,&rdquo; thought
they, &ldquo;but it is equalled by that of every other bird.
We sing in a chorus merely. It would not be so
on earth. We should be &lsquo;prima donnas&rsquo; there.&rdquo;
(Your mother will tell you what a prima donna is as
well as what doing homage means.)</p>

<p>So, when the song was over, they flew to the
Phenix, who was the most important and powerful
bird of all the birds that were in Paradise. I have
told you that all the birds there were equal, and
so they were, only, you see, the Phenix was a little
<i>more</i> equal than the others. One cannot be a Phenix
for nothing. Now it was only the Phenix who could
open the gate of Paradise, and let any bird in or out
of it. He was not obliged to let them in, and there
were very few birds (who were not there already)
that he ever did let in. Many and many a bird
fluttered and fluttered outside the door, that had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
fly away again. But if a bird that was in Paradise
wanted to go out of it, then the Phenix had to open
the door and let it out, because if it had stayed it
would have been discontented, and birds that are
discontented cannot stay in Paradise. It would not
be Paradise for long if they could. So when the
Birds of Paradise said to the Phenix, &ldquo;Let us out, for
we are tired of being here, where all are equal, and
wish to be kings and &lsquo;prima donnas&rsquo; on earth,&rdquo; he had
to do it, only he warned them as the tree had done,
that if they once left Paradise they could never come
back to it again. &ldquo;The door of Paradise,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;may be passed through twice, but only entered
once. When you pass through it the second time,
it is to go out of it, and when you are once out of it,
out of it you must remain. You can never come in
again; you can only flutter at the gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall never do that,&rdquo; said the proud Birds
of Paradise. &ldquo;We shall stay down on earth and be
kings and &lsquo;prima donnas&rsquo; amongst the other birds.&rdquo;
So the Phenix let them out, and they flew down
through the warm summer sky, looking like soft
suns or trembling stars or colours out of the sunrise
or sunset, they were so beautiful.</p>

<p>Then the birds of earth flew around them and did
them homage, and, when they sang, the nightingale
stood silent and hid her head for shame, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
never sing in the daytime any more, but only at
night when the beautiful strangers were asleep. That
is why the nightingale sings by night and not by
day&mdash;only since the Birds of Paradise have lost their
voice (which I am going to tell you about) she does
sing in the daytime sometimes, just a little.</p>

<p>So the Birds of Paradise were kings and &ldquo;prima
donnas&rdquo; amongst the birds of earth, and they were
happy&mdash;for a time. They were not quite so happy
after a little while, for they got tired of hearing the
birds praise them, and, wherever they looked, they
saw nothing to give them pleasure. The earth,
indeed, was beautiful, but they remembered Paradise,
and that made it seem ugly. There was nothing
for them to see that was worth the seeing, or to hear
that was worth the listening to, except their own
beauty and their own song. But that reminded them
of Paradise, and they could not bear to be reminded
of it now that they had lost it for ever. In fact they
were miserable, and it was not long before they
were all fluttering outside the gates of Paradise, and
begging the Phenix to let them in. But the Phenix
said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span> &ldquo;No, I cannot. I warned you that the gates of
Paradise could only be passed twice, once in and once
out, and then no more. I tried to keep you from
going, but you chose to go, and now you must
stay outside. You can never enter Paradise again.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If we cannot enter it,&rdquo; said the poor Birds of
Paradise, &ldquo;let us at least forget it. Take away our
beautiful voices, so that, when we sing, we shall not
think of all the joys we have lost. Let our song be
no more than the lark's or the nightingale's, or make
us only able to twitter, and not sing at all. Then we
can listen to the lark and the nightingale, and
perhaps, in time, we may grow to admire them. As
it is, we must either sing or be silent. We do not
like to sit silent, and when we sing we think only of
Paradise.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Phenix, &ldquo;I will take
your voice, your beautiful voice of song.&rdquo; So he
took it, and that is why the Birds of Paradise never
sing at all now, not even as the lark and the nightingale
sing.</p>

<p>After that they were happier, but still they had their
great beauty, their glorious, glorious plumage, and
when they looked at each other they felt sad and hung
their heads, for still they thought of Paradise. &ldquo;You
have taken our song from us,&rdquo; they said (for they were
soon there at the gate again), &ldquo;but still our beauty
remains. Take that also, that, when we look at each
other, we may not think of the Paradise we have lost,
and be wretched.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fly back to earth,&rdquo; said the
Phenix,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span> &ldquo;and when you are a little way off I will
open the gates of Paradise wide, and the brightness
that is in it will stream out and scorch your feathers,
and you will be beautiful no more. Only you must
fly fast, and you must not turn to look, for if you do,
the brightness will blind you. You could bear it
once when you lived in it and had known nothing
else, but now that you have lived on earth you cannot.
It would only blind you now.&rdquo; So the Birds
of Paradise flew towards the earth, and, when they
had got a little way, the Phenix opened the gates
(he had only been speaking to them through the
keyhole), and, as the splendour of Paradise streamed
forth and fell upon them, their feathers were scorched
in its excessive brightness, all except a few tufts and
plumes which were not quite destroyed, because, you
see, they were getting farther away every second. A
little of their beauty was left, and that was enough
to make them the most beautiful birds on earth
(till we come to the Humming-birds), but they are
very ugly compared to what they once were when
they lived in Paradise. Think then, what the real
Birds of Paradise must be like when those that have
left it, and have had their plumage scorched and
spoilt, are so very beautiful. That is the other way
of explaining how there come to be Birds of Paradise
living on the earth, and I think you will say that it is
the more sensible way of the two. For as for people
having ever believed that there were birds who had
no feet or wings, and that lived always in the air with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
their heads turned towards the sun, why, <i>that</i> does
not seem possible. Nobody could have believed in
a thing like that, but <i>here</i> is a <i>natural</i> explanation.</p>

<p>But now you must not think that the Birds of
Paradise which are in the world to-day, are the very
same ones that used to live in Paradise, and that had
their feathers scorched. Oh no, you must not think
that. Those old Birds of Paradise died (for, of
course, as soon as they came to earth they became
mortal, they had been immortal before), but before
they died they had laid a great many eggs, and
reared a great many young ones, and these young
ones, as soon as they were grown up, laid other eggs,
and the birds that came out of those eggs laid others,
and so it has been going on for hundreds of thousands
of years, right up to now. And <i>now</i>, if you
were to ask a Bird of Paradise where it was he used
to live, and why he had lost his voice and got his
feathers scorched, he would not know one bit what
you were talking about. In hundreds of thousands
of years a great many things are forgotten, and the
Birds of Paradise of to-day are quite happy. The
earth is quite good enough for them, and if they
were not shot and put into hats for the women with
the frozen hearts to wear, they would have nothing
to complain of. They have something to complain
of now, but you must remember your promise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
and then, perhaps, they will not be shot any
more.</p>

<p>Now, the Birds of Paradise that live on the earth
to-day do not live all over it, as they used to do in
those old days when they could hear the lark and
the nightingale. It is only a very small part of the
world that they live in now&mdash;small, I mean, compared
to the rest of it&mdash;and there are no larks or nightingales
there. I will tell you where it is. Far away
over the deep sea, farther than Africa, farther than
India, farther even than Burma or Siam, there are
a number of great islands and small islands and
middling-sized islands, which lie between Asia and
Australia, and all of these together are called the
Malay Archipelago. The largest of all these islands,
and the one that is farthest away too, is called New
Guinea, and it is a very large island indeed, the
largest, in fact, in the world after Australia, which,
as you know, is so large that we call it a continent.
Round about this great island of New Guinea, and
not very far from its shores, there are some other
islands which are quite tiny in comparison, and it is
here, just in this one great island and in these few
small islands near it, that the Birds of Paradise live.
They do not live in any of the other islands of the
Malay Archipelago, but only just here in the ones
that are farthest away of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>It would take you weeks to go in a steamer to
where the Birds of Paradise live, and if you were to
go, not in a steamer but in a ship with sails, it would
take you longer still. But when you got there you
would not see the Birds of Paradise flying all about,
as soon as you went ashore out of the ship or the
steamer, as you would see sparrows here. Oh no,
Birds of Paradise are not so common as that, even
in their own country. They do not come into the
towns, like sparrows, either, but live in the great
forests where people do not often go, and even when
one does go into them, it is difficult to see them
amongst the great tall trees and the broad-fronded
ferns and the long, hanging creepers that make a
tangle from one tree to another.</p>

<p>Ah, those are wonderful forests, those forests far
away over the seas! Some of the trees have trunks so
thick that a dozen men&mdash;or perhaps twenty&mdash;would
not be able to circle them round by joining their
hands together, and so tall that when you looked up
you would not be able to see their tops. They
would go shooting up and up like the spires of great
cathedrals, till at last they would be lost in a green
sky, not the real sky, the blue one&mdash;that would be
higher up still&mdash;but a green sky of leaves made by
all the trees themselves, and in this sky of leaves
there would be flower-stars almost as bright and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
beautiful as the real stars of the real sky. Then
there are other trees that have their roots growing
right out of the ground, and going up more
than a hundred feet high into the air. At the top
of them is the tree itself, going up another hundred
feet, or perhaps more, so that the real tree&mdash;the
trunk at any rate&mdash;begins in the air, and before you
could climb it, you would have to climb its roots,
which <i>does</i> seem funny. And there are palm-trees
with long, tall, slender trunks, smooth and shining,
crowned with leaves that are like large green fans;
and rattan-palms, which are quite different, for
instead of being straight, their trunks twist round
and round the trunks of other trees, going right up
to their very tops, and raising their own most beautiful
feathery ones above theirs. Sometimes they will
climb first up one tree and then down it again, and
up another, and then down that, till they have climbed
up and down several trees, all of them very, very
tall. How tall&mdash;or rather how <i>long</i>&mdash;<i>they</i> must be
you may think. We say that a snake is so many
feet long, not tall, and these rattan-palms are palm-creepers,
great vegetable serpents, that twist and coil
as they grow, and hug the forest in their great coils,
which are larger and more powerful than those of
any python or boa-constrictor. A python or a boa-constrictor
could not kill a <i>very</i> large animal, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
great palm-snakes will crawl up the largest tree, and
crush it and squeeze it till at last it dies and comes
thundering down in the forest, and then they will
crawl along the ground to another, and hug that to
death, too. Then there are tree-ferns, which are ferns
that have trunks like trees, which are sometimes thirty
feet high, with fronds growing from their tops, so
broad and tall that a number of people could sit
underneath them in their cool, deep shade, as if they
were a tent. And there are wonderful flowers in
these forests, such as you only see here in botanical
gardens or in the conservatories of rich people, orchids
and pitcher-plants, and others with Latin names that
one forgets. Some of them are flower-trees, or tree-flowers,
as high as the trees are, and with hundreds
of large, crimson blossoms glowing out like stars from
their trunks. When you come upon them all at once
in the gloom of the forest, it almost looks as if some
of the trees were on fire.</p>

<p>Other flowers are golden like the sun and grow
all together in clusters, whilst others, again, grow on
the branches of trees and hang down from them by
long stalks which are like threads, each thread-stalk
strung with flowers, as a thread is strung with
beads. Only these flower-beads are as large as sunflowers,
with colours varying from orange to red, and
with beautiful, deep, purple-red spots upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>But if you had wings like the Birds of Paradise,
and could fly over the tops of the trees that make
the forest, and look down into a leafy meadow
instead of up into a leafy sky, then you would
see the most gloriously beautiful flowers growing
in that meadow, just as the daisies and buttercups
grow in the meadows that you run over,
here. For flowers love the light of the sun, and
they struggle up into it through the leaves that
keep it out. To them the leaves are not as the
sky, but as the clouds that shut the sky out, and as
they are clouds that will never roll away (even
though they may fall sometimes in a rain of leaves),
the only thing for them to do is to climb up to
them and pierce them, and see the sky, with the
sun shining in it, on the other side. So whilst a
few flowers stay in the shade below, most of them
grow and struggle up into the light and air above,
and they are all in such a hurry to get there that
every one tries to grow faster than all the others.
Ah! what a race it is, a race to reach the sun.
You have heard of all sorts of races, and some,
perhaps, you have seen; running-races, races in sacks,
boat-races, horse-races (though those, I hope, you
never have and never will see), but you never either
saw or heard of a fairer, lovelier, more delicate
race than a race of flowers to reach the sun. Think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
of it, all over those great, wide, far-stretching
forests, forests stretching away like the sea, and
only bounded by the sea! Think of all the millions
of flowers there must be in them, with all their
delicate shapes, and rich, fragrant scents and glorious
colours, and then think of them all growing up
together, each trying to be the first to see the sun.
So eager they all are, but so gentle. There is no
pushing, nothing rude or rough. But as the leaves
grow thinner, and the light shines more and more
through them, they tremble and sigh with joy, and
one says to another, &ldquo;We are getting nearer&mdash;nearer.
I can see him almost; we shall soon be
bathed in his light.&rdquo; And so they all grow and
grow till at last they gleam softly through the soft
leaves, and see the beautiful deep blue sky and the
glorious, golden sun. Yes, that is a lovely race
indeed&mdash;as anything to do with flowers is lovely&mdash;and
it is a race upwards, to the sky and to the
sun. Not all races are of that kind.</p>

<p>It is in forests like those that the Birds of Paradise
live; and now that we know something about where
they live, we will find out something about them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
The Great Bird of Paradise</h2>

<p>The Great Bird of Paradise lives in the middle
of the great island called New Guinea, and all over
some quite little islands close to it which are called
the Aru Islands. He is the largest of the Birds
of Paradise, and perhaps he is the most beautiful,
but it is not so easy to be sure about <i>that</i>. However,
we shall see what you think of him. His
body and wings and tail are brown. &ldquo;What, only
brown?&rdquo; you cry. &ldquo;That is like a sparrow.&rdquo; Ah,
but wait. It is not <i>quite</i> like a sparrow. It is a
beautiful, rich, <i>coffee</i>-brown, and on the breast it
deepens into a most lovely, dark, <i>purple-violet</i> brown.
There! That is different to being just brown like
a sparrow, is it not? Then the head and neck are
yellow, not a common yellow, but a very pretty,
light, delicate yellow, like straw. Sometimes ladies
have hair of that colour, and when they have, then
people look at them and say, &ldquo;What beautiful
hair!&rdquo; which is just what they themselves say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
sometimes, when they look in the glass. These
feathers are very short and set closely together,
which makes them look like plush or velvet, so you
can think how handsome they must be. What
would you think if you were to go out for a walk
and see a bird flying about with a yellow plush or
yellow velvet head? But the throat is handsomer
still. <i>That</i> is a glorious, gleaming, metallic green.
Some feathers are called &ldquo;metallic,&rdquo; because when
the light shines on them they flash it back again
just as a bright piece of metal does; a helmet or a
breastplate, for instance. You know how <i>they</i> flash
and gleam in the sunshine when the Horse-Guards
ride by. At least, if you have seen the Horse-Guards,
you do, and if you have not, well, I daresay you have
seen it in a dish-cover or a bright coal-scuttle. But
fancy feathers as soft as velvet, gleaming as if they
were polished metal, but gleaming all emerald green
as if they were jewels&mdash;emeralds&mdash;too! Then on
the forehead and the chin of this bird&mdash;by which
I mean just under the beak&mdash;there are glossy velvety
plumes of a deeper green colour. The other is
emerald. These are like the deep, lovely greens that
one sees sometimes in the fiery opal or the mother-of-pearl.
What jewellery! and out of it all flash two
other jewels&mdash;the bird's two eyes&mdash;which are of a
beautiful bright yellow colour to match with the yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
plush of its head. Then this bird has a pale blue beak
and pale pink legs, and I am sure if he thinks himself
very handsome, you can <i>hardly</i> call him conceited.
For he would be handsome only with this that I have
told you about; that would be quite enough to make
him a beautiful bird without anything else.</p>

<p>But <i>has</i> he anything else&mdash;any other kind of
beauty <i>besides</i> what I have told you about? Listen.
The emerald throat and the yellow velvet-plush
head and the blue beak and the pink legs are as
nothing, nothing whatever, compared to the glorious
plumes which this Bird of Paradise has on each side
of his body. Oh, you never saw such plumes, and
you cannot think how lovely they are. There are
two of them&mdash;one on each side&mdash;and each one is
made up of a number of very long, soft, delicate
silky feathers, which are of an orange-gold or
golden-orange colour, and so bright and glossy that
they shine in the sun like floss-silk. Just where they
spring from the body each one of them has a stripe
of deep crimson-red, and, towards the top, they soften
into a pretty pale, mauvy brown. Even one feather
like that on each side would be beautiful&mdash;or one all
by itself in the middle&mdash;but fancy a <i>plume</i> of them
on each side, a thick plume too, though each feather
is so slender and delicate&mdash;there are so many of them.
They look lovely enough when they stream out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
behind as the bird flies, for they are twice as long as
its whole body, so, of course, the two plumes come
together and make one lovely large one that lies as
softly on the air as the feather of a swan does on the
water. The body, then, is almost covered up in all
these soft feathers, so that it is just like looking at
a flying plume with wings and a head to it.</p>

<p>Yes, they look lovely enough then, these glorious
plumes; but sometimes they look lovelier still, and
that is when the Great Bird of Paradise raises them
both up above its back so that they shoot into the air
like two golden feather-fountains that mingle together
and bend over and fall in spray all around, only it is a
spray of feathers&mdash;not a real spray&mdash;and, instead of
falling, they only wave and dance. Such a glorious,
plumy cascade! The bird himself is almost hidden
in his own shower-bath, but the emerald throat and
the yellow-plush head look out of it and gleam like
jewels as he peeps and peers about from side to side
to see if any one is looking at him. For, of course,
the Great Bird of Paradise does not make himself so
<i>very</i> beautiful just for nothing. When he shoots up
his feather-fountains and sits in a soft, silky shower-bath,
he does it to be looked at, and the person he
wants to look at him most is the hen Great Bird of
Paradise, for&mdash;do you know and <i>can</i> you believe it?&mdash;the
poor hen Great Bird of Paradise is <i>not</i> beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
She has no wonderful plumes&mdash;she has no plumes at
all&mdash;and out of all those splendid colours I have told
you about&mdash;orangy-gold and emerald green and all
the rest of them&mdash;she has only one, which is the
coffee-brown. Now, of course, a nice rich coffee-brown
is a very good colour, but still, by itself it is
not enough to make a bird one of the most beautiful
birds in the world. So when a bird is <i>only</i> coffee-brown,
then, compared to a bird who has all those
other colours and the most wonderful plumes as well,
it is quite a plain bird. So a poor hen Great Bird of
Paradise is quite a plain bird compared to her handsome
husband, with his emerald throat and yellow-plush
head and his wonderful orangy-gold plumes.</p>

<p>But, then, if the poor hen bird has no glorious
plumes of her own, she is always looking at them,
always having them spread out on purpose for her
to look at, and that must be very pleasant indeed.
When the male Great Birds of Paradise wish to show
their poor plain hens how handsome they are&mdash;just
to comfort them and make them not mind being
plain themselves&mdash;they come to a particular kind of
tree in the forest, a tree that has a great many wide-spreading
branches at the top, with not so very many
leaves upon them, so that it is easy for them to be
seen by the hens, who are sitting in other trees near,
all ready to watch them. Then they raise up their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
wings above their backs, stretch out their emerald
necks, bow their yellow heads politely to each other,
and shoot up their golden feather-fountains, making
each of the long, plumy tufts tremble and vibrate and
quiver, as they droop all over them and almost cover
them up. The plumes begin from under the wings&mdash;that
is why they lift their wings up first so that they
can shoot straight up and so that the hen birds may
see the little stripes of red, which I told you about,
and which look like little crimson clouds floating in
a little golden sunset. How beautiful they must
look! Perhaps there may be a dozen Great Birds of
Paradise, all bowing their heads and quivering their
plumes, on a dozen branches of the tree, whilst a
dozen more will be flying about from one branch to
another, so that the tree and the air are full of beauty.
The air never had anything to float upon her softer
or lovelier than those golden floating plumes, and no
tree ever bore blossoms <i>quite</i> so beautiful as those
wonderful golden Paradise-flowers. And both the
air and the trees are happy. Both of them whisper,
&ldquo;Oh thank you, thank you, Birds of Paradise.&rdquo; Of
course the Birds of Paradise are happy too. They
are happy to have such beauty and to be able to
show it to the hens, who sit hidden in the trees and
bushes around, and <i>they</i> perhaps&mdash;the hens for whom
it is all done&mdash;are happiest of all. Then it is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
happiness&mdash;and beauty. Beauty and happiness, those
are the two things it is made up of.</p>

<p>There are not so many things that are made up of
just those two. Try and think of some. A party,
perhaps you may say (only it must be a juvenile one),
or a pantomime. Well, of course, there is an <i>enormous</i>
amount of beauty and happiness at things of that
kind; but is it <i>all</i> beauty and happiness? Not <i>quite</i>
all, I think. Still I am sure you would think it a very
unkind thing if somebody were to break up a party
before it were over, or to stop a pantomime before
the last act had been performed. You would think
that cruel, I am sure. And now if you were looking
at those beautiful, happy Birds of Paradise at <i>their</i>
party or pantomime (I <i>think</i> it is as pretty as a
transformation scene), and all at once, when they were
just in the middle of it, first one and then another of
them were to fall down dead to the ground, till at
last half of them lay there underneath the tree and
the rest had flown away, would you not think <i>that</i>
a most cruel and dreadful thing? Where would be
the beauty and the happiness now? It would all be
gone. Joy would have been changed into sorrow,
and beauty <i>almost</i> into ugliness&mdash;for a dead bird is
<i>almost</i> ugly compared to a beautiful, living one.
And life would have been changed into death&mdash;yes,
and <i>such</i> life, the life of happy, lovely birds, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
Birds of Paradise. And I think that if you were there
and saw that happen&mdash;saw those beautiful birds fall
down dead&mdash;<i>murdered</i>&mdash;all of a sudden&mdash;you would
be sorry and angry too, and you would say that only
a demon could have done so wicked a thing.</p>

<p>You would be right if you were to say so. It
<i>could</i> only be a demon&mdash;that same little demon
that I told you about who sang a charm to send
the Goddess of Pity to sleep and then froze
the hearts of the women with his bad, wicked
powder. That wretched little demon who wears the
magic suit of clothes, which makes him seem all that
he ought to be, is always killing the poor Birds of
Paradise, just when they are feeling so happy and
looking so beautiful. He does not do it himself
(any more than the women), for, as he could not be
in more than one place at a time, he would not be
able to kill a sufficient number to satisfy him, and
besides he has a great many other things of the same
kind, but more important, to do. So he makes his
servants do it. That has always been his plan. He has
servants all over the world, and you must not think that
they are as bad as himself, for that is not the case at all.
They are not bad, but enchanted, so that they do all
sorts of bad things without having any idea that they are
bad. In fact they generally think that they are the
finest things in the world. The demon has all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
little bottles with different kinds of powders in them,
one for every kind of servant that he wants. In his
little private workshop they all stand in rows upon a
shelf and every one has a different label on it, so that
he knows which to take up in a minute. One is
labelled &ldquo;Glory,&rdquo; and has a powder in it of all sorts
of different colours, scarlet, blue, green, white, and a
little of it dirty yellow. The man on whom a grain
of this powder falls will always be wanting to kill
people, and the more he kills the better man he will
think himself, and so, too, will other people think
him. You may imagine what a lot of work the
demon can get out of a servant like that. Another
one is labelled &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; and whoever the powder
in that falls on will go through life always saying what
he doesn't believe, and trying to make other people
believe it. Others are labelled &ldquo;Patriotism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Duty,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Culture,&rdquo; &ldquo;Refinement,&rdquo; &ldquo;Taste,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sensibility,&rdquo; and
so on (all which words your mother will explain to
you). The demon chooses them according to the
kind of thing he wants done, and all on whom any
of the powders inside the bottles fall become his
servants in different ways&mdash;very grand ways, too,
they are often thought&mdash;and go on serving him and
thinking well of themselves, and being held always
in great honour and respect, all their lives.</p>

<p>Now you must not, of course, think that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
bottles <i>really</i> contain the things that are written on
their labels. No, indeed, they are <i>false</i> labels, for, you
see, <i>these</i> bottles stand in the window where people can
see them, the demon does not keep them in his pocket
like those other two I told you of. So when people
see them they think that they have good powders
instead of bad ones inside them, and when the
stoppers are taken out the powders fly into their eyes,
and they are blinded and never know the difference.
Almost every one is blinded, for the demon just
stands at the window of his workshop and blows his
powders through the world. It is not necessary for
him to walk up and down in it sprinkling them
about. That would be a long, tedious way of doing
things. He just blows them, and he need never be
afraid of blowing too much away, for his bottles are
magic bottles and always full. Outside his window
there is always a great crowd looking at the bottles
and admiring them, whilst the demon stands there in
his magic suit of clothes, and seems to every one to be
just what he ought to be.</p>

<p>They say that somewhere else in the world there
is a very beautiful house with a radiant angel inside it,
and that there, in vases of crystal and diamond&mdash;or
something like crystal and diamond, but very much
more beautiful&mdash;are the real things which the demon
only pretends to have in his ugly little bottles. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
one has only to step in and ask for them, and the angel
will open the vase and shed the essence that is inside
it into his very heart. But&mdash;is it not funny?&mdash;hardly
anybody ever goes into that house, and the few who do
cannot persuade others to follow them. I will tell you
why this is. The beautiful house does not <i>look</i> like a
beautiful house at all to most people, and the angel
of light who sits in the open doorway seems to them
to be only a shabbily dressed, unfashionable sort of
person. Nobody sees his wings, or, if they do, they
think wings are vulgar and out of date. It is the
demon who is to blame for this. He has had time
to blow his magic powders all about the world, and
they have blinded people's eyes and made what is
really beautiful seem mean and ugly to them&mdash;for
the demon's powders can blind the eyes as well as
freeze the heart. But the little workshop of the
demon, which is really as mean and wretched a place
as you could find, <i>that</i> people think glorious and beautiful,
and his ugly bottles are to them as vases of crystal
and diamond. So they crowd about the demon's
workshop, thinking it to be the angel's house, and
into the angel's house they never go, for they think a
demon&mdash;or at least an unfashionably dressed person
with wings&mdash;which are out of date&mdash;lives there.</p>

<p>Now, it is one of those bottles with the false labels
which the demon takes when he wants one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
servants in that part of the world to kill the Great
Bird of Paradise; for I don't think the men in those
countries would much mind what the women said to
them. I cannot tell you which bottle it is, but it
is none of those that I have told you about. The
label upon it is not nearly such a grand one, and
the powder is of a much coarser grain, for the man
that the demon is going to blow it at is only a poor
savage, who is black and nearly naked, and who is
not able to serve him in such important ways as are
people of a lighter colour and less scantily dressed.
He is only fit to do little odd jobs now and again,
and his wages are very low in consequence. Even
what he gets he is often not allowed to keep, for the
demon's upper servants take them away from him,
and he is not strong enough to resist. One of his
odd jobs is killing the poor Great Birds of Paradise,
and now I will tell you how he does it. Only you must
not be angry with him, or even with the other people
whose servant he <i>thinks</i> he is, though they are all of
them <i>really</i> the servants of one master, that wretched
little demon in the magic suit of clothes, which makes
him seem nice to everybody, although he is so nasty.
It is <i>he</i> you must be angry with, for it is he who does
all the mischief, in the way I have told you. He
gets people into his power; but, if you do as I tell
you, perhaps you will be able to save them from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
and to save the poor, beautiful Birds of Paradise, as
well as other beautiful birds, from being killed and
killed until they are all dead. Think what a lot of
good you will have done, then, to have kept such
beauty safe in the world, when it might have been
lost out of it for ever. Yes, and you will have
done more good than that even, for you will have
helped to wake up the Goddess of Pity, and when
once she is awake there will be so much for her to
do&mdash;for, ah! she has been asleep so long.</p>

<p>But, now, listen. I have told you that the man
who kills the Great Bird of Paradise is black and
naked and a savage. But he is not a negro, although
he is rather like one. His hair is something like a
negro's hair, but there is much more of it. In fact
it is quite a mop, and he is very proud of it. He is
a Papuan, and the islands that he lives in are called
the Papuan Islands, and are a very long way from
Africa, which is where the negroes live. He is a tall,
fine-looking man, with a beautiful figure, and he
looks very much better naked than he would do if
he were dressed. And when I said that he was black,
this was not <i>quite</i> true, because he is really brown,
but it is such a very dark brown that it looks black,
and when a man is such a very dark brown that he
looks black, then people <i>will</i> call him a black man, so
that is what we will call this Papuan. Now, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
black man is very quick and active&mdash;which is what
most savages are&mdash;and he can climb trees almost as
well as a monkey. When he finds one of those trees
where the Great Birds of Paradise have their parties,
their &ldquo;Sacalelies&rdquo; (that is what <i>he</i> calls them, it is a
word that means a dancing-party), he climbs up into
it early in the morning, before it is daylight, and
waits for them to come. It does not matter how tall
the tree is (and this kind of tree is very tall), or how
dark it may be, this naked Papuan savage climbs
up it quite easily and without slipping, just like a
monkey. He takes up with him some leafy branches
of another tree, and with these he makes a little
screen to sit under, so that the Birds of Paradise shall
not see him. Besides this, he takes his bow and
arrows to shoot the poor birds with, for he does not
use a gun, which would make too much noise, and,
besides, the shot would hurt the beautiful plumage.
The arrows do not hurt the plumage as the shot
would, because at the end of each one there is a piece
of wood, shaped something like an acorn, but as large
as a teacup, and the large end of it makes what
would be the point of an ordinary arrow. When the
poor birds are hit with that great, smooth piece of
wood they are killed, because it hits them so hard,
but their plumage is not hurt at all, for nothing has
gone into the skin, or torn the feathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>So the naked black man waits behind his screen
for the Great Birds of Paradise to come, and as soon
as they come and begin to spread their plumes, he
shoots first one and then another of them with
his great wooden arrows, and they fall down dead
underneath the tree. And, do you know, they are
so occupied in showing off their beautiful plumes, and
so happy and excited as they spread them out and
look through them, or fly like little feathery cascades
from branch to branch, that it is not till quite a
number of them have been killed (for the black
savage does not often miss his aim) that the others
take fright and fly away. Then the black man
climbs down from the tree and picks up the poor,
beautiful, dead birds and takes them to another man
who is yellow and not quite so naked as he is, who
gives him something for them, but not so much as he
ought to. The yellow man cheats the black man,
and, when he has cheated him, he takes the skins to a
white man, who is quite dressed and civilised, and sells
them to him, and the white man cheats <i>him</i> a good
deal more than <i>he</i> has cheated the black man&mdash;for, of
course, the white man is the cleverest of the three.
(You see there are yellow men in those countries&mdash;called
Malays&mdash;as well as black men, and a good
many white men go there as well.) Then the white
man puts all the beautiful skins that he has bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
from the yellow man, as well as a great many others
which have been brought to him from all the country
and from all the islands round about, into one of
those large kinds of boxes called &ldquo;crates,&rdquo; that I
have told you about, and it is put on board a ship
where there are a great many others of the same kind,
all full of the skins and feathers of beautiful birds
that have been killed. And the ship sails to England,
and then up the Thames to London, where the crates
are taken out and put into great vans and driven
away to the great ugly warehouses to be unpacked
and laid on the floor there in a heap, all
as I have told you. You know what happens to
them then.</p>

<p>And now I will tell you something funny that I
daresay you would never have thought of, but which is
quite true all the same. That great heap of brightly
coloured feathers lying on the floor, to make which
hundreds of thousands of the most beautiful birds in
the world have been killed, and hundreds of hundreds
of thousands of their young ones that would have grown
up beautiful, too, have been starved to death in the nest&mdash;that
great big heap of the loveliest plumage is not
so lovely, not nearly so beautiful as one living thrush
or one living blackbird or one living swallow or one
living robin-redbreast. That is the difference between
life and death. A live Bird of Paradise is hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
of times more beautiful than a live blackbird or thrush
or swallow or robin-redbreast, but when it is dead it
is not so beautiful as they are. Its feathers are more
beautiful, still, of course, but where are the <i>waving</i>
feathers, the <i>floating</i> plumes, the bright eyes, the quick,
graceful movements, and the flight&mdash;the glorious flight&mdash;of
a bird. They are gone, they are gone for ever,
and, in their place, there is only stiffness and deadness
and dustiness. Oh never, never wish to see a dead
Bird of Paradise in a hat, when you can see a living
thrush or blackbird on the lawn of your garden, or a
living swallow flying over it. And even if you can
never see a living Bird of Paradise&mdash;as I daresay you
never will be able to&mdash;what then?&mdash;what then? You
cannot see everything, but have you not got an imagination
(your mother, who has got one, will tell you
what it is), and is it not better to imagine a beautiful
bird flying about in life and loveliness than to see it
dead? And the people who have these hats with the
Birds of Paradise, or with other beautiful birds, sewn
into them, how much do you think they really care
about them? Do they ever look at them after they
have once bought them? Oh no, they never do.
Sometimes they look in the glass with the hat on&mdash;yes&mdash;but
then it is only to see themselves <i>in</i> the
hat, not the hat.</p>

<p>So now you know what kind of birds the Birds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
Paradise are, and how very beautiful they are, and you
know how gloriously beautiful the Great Bird of Paradise
is, and how it is killed and not allowed to live and
be happy, just because it is so beautiful. But now these
Great Birds of Paradise live only in some quite small
islands and just in one part of one large one, and
although there may be a good many of them where
they do live, yet if they are always being killed in
that way, very soon there will be no more of them
left. Then there will be no more Great Birds of
Paradise in the world&mdash;for they do not live outside
those islands&mdash;and when they are once gone they can
never, never come again.</p>

<p>But do you not think that it would be a dreadful
thing if such a bird as this&mdash;this beautiful Great Bird
of Paradise that I have told you about&mdash;were to be
killed and killed until it was not in the world any
more? Of course you think it would be a dreadful
thing, and I am sure that you would prevent it if you
could. And you <i>can</i> prevent it&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;yes, <i>now</i>&mdash;and
in the easiest way possible. All you have to do&mdash;only
you must do it directly&mdash;is to put your arms
round your mother's neck and make her promise
never, never to wear a hat with the feathers of a
Great Bird of Paradise in it. Of course she will
promise, if you ask her in that way, and keep on, and
when she once has promised you must not let her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
forget it. You must remind her of it from time to
time (&ldquo;Remember, mother, you <i>promised</i>&rdquo;), and,
especially, when you hear her talking about getting a
new hat. And when you have made her promise
about herself, then you must make her promise never
to let <i>you</i> wear a hat of the sort (of course when you
are grown-up and buy your own hats you never will),
or your sisters either. And if you have a sister very
much older than yourself who buys her own hats,
then you can make <i>her</i> promise too. Perhaps <i>that</i>
will be less easy, but she will do it in time if you tease
her enough about it and want her to read the book.
And then if you can get any other lady to promise,
well, the more who do, the better chance there will be
for the beautiful Great Bird of Paradise. Only you
must make your mother promise first&mdash;that is the
chief thing&mdash;and, to do it, you must tell her all about
the wicked little demon, with his powders and his
charm to send the Goddess of Pity to sleep. So now
go to your mother, go at once, do not wait, or, if
your mother is out anywhere, you must only wait till
she comes home again.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
The Red Bird of Paradise</h2>


<p>Then there is another very beautiful Bird of
Paradise which is called the Red Bird of Paradise.
It is no use trying to find out whether he or the
one I have just been telling you about is the most
beautiful, because if somebody were to think that one
were, somebody else would be sure to have a different
opinion. But now I will tell you what this Red Bird
of Paradise is like, and then you will know how beautiful
to think him. You know those lovely plumes
that I told you about, that the Great Bird of Paradise
has growing from both his sides, under the
wings, and how he lifts up his wings and shoots them
right up into the air, so that they fall all over him,
like two most beautiful fountains that meet in the air
and mingle their waters together. Now the Red Bird of
Paradise has those plumes&mdash;those feather-fountains&mdash;too,
and he can shoot them up into the air and let
them fall all over him, and look out from amongst
them as they bend and wave, and think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span> &ldquo;How lovely
I am!&rdquo; just the same as the Great Bird of Paradise
can. They are not so long, it is true, but then they
are very thick, and of a most glorious crimson colour&mdash;such
a colour as you see, sometimes, in the western
sky, when the sun is flushing it, just before he sinks
down for the night. People talk about a sky like
that and call it a glorious sunset when they see it in
Switzerland. One can see it here, too, if one likes,
but it is not usual to talk about it or even to
look at it, unless one is in Switzerland (your mother
will tell you the reason of this). Fancy a bird that
looks out of a crimson sunset of feathers&mdash;crimson,
but with beautiful white tips to them! Crimson and
white, that is almost more splendid than orange-gold
and mauvy-brown; unless you like orange-gold and
mauvy-brown better&mdash;it is all a matter of taste.</p>

<p>But there is another thing that the Red Bird of Paradise
has, which the Great Bird of Paradise has not got
at all. He has two little crests of feathers&mdash;beautiful
metallic green feathers&mdash;on his forehead. Just fancy!
Not one crest, merely, but two. One talks about a
feather in one's cap (which, of course, a <i>bird</i> may have
without its being wrong); but what is a feather in one's
cap compared to two crests of feathers on one's forehead?
And such crests! And, besides his crimson
sunset plumes with their white tips and the two little
lovely green crests on his forehead, this bird has two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
wonderful feathers in his tail; they are not feathers
at all, really, that is to say, the soft part of them on
each side of the quill, which we call the web, is gone,
and there is only the quill left, but it is such a funny
sort of quill that you would never think it was one.
It is flat and smooth and shiny, and quite a quarter of
an inch wide. In fact it looks like a ribbon, a beautiful,
black, glossy ribbon, twenty-two inches (which is
almost two feet) long.</p>

<p>These two wonderful ribbons&mdash;I told you there
were two&mdash;hang down in graceful curves as the bird sits
on the branch of a tree, first a curve out and then in
and then out again, just at the tips, so that the two
together make quite a pretty figure. Of course, when
there is any wind at all, they float gracefully about
and look very pretty indeed, and when the Red Bird
of Paradise flies, his two wonderful ribbons float in the
air behind him, just as if he had been into a linen-draper's
shop and bought something, and flown out
again with it, in his tail. And yet, to make these two
pretty ribbons&mdash;which are feathers, really, though
they do not look like them&mdash;the soft part of
the feather, which is usually the pretty part, has
been taken away, and only the quill, which is usually
almost ugly by comparison, has been left. And
yet they are so handsome. That is because Dame
Nature is such a wonderful workwoman. She can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
make almost anything she tries to, out of any kind
of material.</p>

<p>Now, I must tell you that the Great Bird of
Paradise has two funny feathers like this in <i>his</i> tail
too&mdash;feathers, I mean, without webs to them&mdash;only
his ones have just a little web at the beginning and,
again, at the very tips; all the part in between has
none at all. These funny feathers of the Great Bird
of Paradise are even longer than those of the red one,
for they are from twenty-four to thirty-four inches
long, and thirty-four inches, you know, is almost
three feet. But then they are thin, not broad like
ribbons, and the plumes of the Great Bird of Paradise
are so long that they are a good deal hidden by them,
and, sometimes, hardly noticed amongst such a lot of
finery. I think that must be why, when I was describing
the Great Bird of Paradise to you, I forgot all about
them, which, of course, I ought not to have done. But
we all of us make mistakes sometimes, people who
write books just as much as people who only read
them, although, of course, people who <i>write</i> books
<i>ought</i> to be more careful.</p>

<p>In fact, a great many of the Birds of Paradise have
these funny feathers, and some of them have more
than two. If you look for page 77 you will see a
picture of the King Bird of Paradise, who has two
beauties. He is not one of the birds that I talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
about in this book&mdash;there was no room for him&mdash;but
that does not matter. He sent me his picture,
and it will show you what these &ldquo;funny feathers&rdquo;
are like. There <i>is</i> a Bird of Paradise that has twelve
of them, but now I must finish talking about the
Red Bird of Paradise. I have told you about
the glorious crimson plumes that he has on his
sides, and the two funny feathers, like ribbons, in
his tail, and the double crest of beautiful emerald-green
feathers on his forehead, but, of course, there
are other parts of him besides these, and I must
tell you what they are like too. His head and
his back and his shoulders are yellow, as they are
in the Great Bird of Paradise, but it is a deeper
and richer yellow, not the light, straw-coloured
yellow which <i>he</i> has and which is very pretty too (I
am sure we should never agree as to which is the
prettier of these two birds). His throat, too, is of a
deep metallic green colour&mdash;you know what metallic
means now&mdash;but those lovely green feathers go
farther up, in fact right over the front part of the
head&mdash;which is his forehead&mdash;so as to make those
two sweet little crests which he has, and which help
to make him such a very handsome bird. The rest
of his wings and body, and his tail, except the two
ribbons in it, are brown&mdash;a nice, handsome, rich,
coffee-brown&mdash;his legs are blue, and his beak is a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
gamboge-yellow. Ah, <i>there</i> is a beautiful bird indeed!
What would you say if you were to see a bird that was
yellow and green with crimson-sunset plumes, and with
two long glossy ribbons in his tail, and two beautiful
crests on his forehead, with blue legs and a gamboge
bill, flying from tree to tree in your garden?</p>

<p>Ah, yes, if you were to see him like that he would
be more beautiful than any bird that has ever been
in your garden or that has ever flown about in the
woods or fields all over England&mdash;for he would be
alive then&mdash;alive and happy. But if you were to see
him dead he would not be so beautiful as any of the
birds in your garden&mdash;no, not even as the sparrows
(which is saying a good deal), for the beauty of life
would be gone out of him, and that is the greatest
beauty of all. And even if he were in a cage&mdash;unless
it were a <i>very</i> large one with a great many trees in
it&mdash;he would hardly look as beautiful as a lark does
when he sails and sings in the sky.</p>

<p>So, however beautiful this bird is, you must only
want to see him flying about in the forests or gardens
of his native land, if ever you go there. If you do
not go there, then you must not mind, but you must
try to imagine him, which is almost as good as seeing
him, if you do it properly. But you must never want
to see him in a cage that is smaller than a large
garden with trees in it, or dead in a glass case or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
hat. It is better that beautiful birds should be alive
and you not see them, than that they should be
killed or made miserable for you to look at.</p>

<p>Now you may be sure that if the poor Great Bird
of Paradise is killed because he is so beautiful, so is
the poor Red Bird of Paradise because <i>he</i> is. It is
dreadful to <i>be</i> sure of such a thing, and it is all because
of the wicked little demon, and the Goddess of Pity
being asleep. When the wicked little demon has
been driven away, and the Goddess of Pity has been
woken up&mdash;and it is you who are going to wake
her&mdash;then you may be sure that no beautiful birds
will be killed, and that the more beautiful they are
the less people will ever think of killing them. But
that time is not come yet. It will not come till you
have read this book right through and finished it.</p>

<p>Now you remember that the Great Bird of Paradise
is shot with arrows by a naked black man with
frizzly hair like a mop&mdash;a man that we call a savage,
though, really, he is not nearly so savage as some
men who wear clothes all over them. You see, where
he lives it is very warm, so that he does not want
clothes, and he looks very much better without them,
for his black, smooth skin is very handsome indeed,
and so is his frizzly hair. If you saw him you would
think him a very nice, amiable person, for he is always
laughing and springing about, and his white teeth do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
flash so and his eyes beam, and he looks very pleasant
indeed. I think you would quite like him, so you
must not despise him because he is not civilised like
us; never despise people because they have a different
coloured skin to your own and wear no clothes and
are called savages. Perhaps we may be better than
people like that, but remember that the angels are much
better compared to us, than we are, compared to such
people. But do you think the angels <i>despise</i> us? Oh
no, you <i>could</i> not think that, so <i>you</i> must not despise
the savages. Never despise any one, that is the best
thing. Instead of doing that, try to find out what is
good about them&mdash;there is sure to be something, and,
often, it is something which <i>they</i> have and <i>we</i> have
not. <i>Never despise.</i></p>

<p>Well, it is this same naked, frizzly-haired Papuan
who kills the beautiful Red Bird of Paradise as well
as the Great one, but he does not do it with bows and
arrows, but in quite another way, which I will tell you
about.</p>

<p>The Birds of Paradise are all fond of fruit; they
like insects and things of that sort too, but fruit they
are <i>very</i> fond of. They like a nice ripe fig, and there
are so many fig-trees in that country, both growing
wild and in the gardens too, that when the figs are
ripe they do not trouble to finish one before they
begin another, but fly about from tree to tree, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
a bite here and another there, out of just the ripest
and nicest. That is a nice, delicate way of eating figs,
<i>I</i> think, just to take a little and leave the rest. We
are so greedy that we always eat the whole fig, but
then <i>we</i> are not Birds of Paradise.</p>

<p>But now there is one particular fruit which the Red
Bird of Paradise likes better than any other, much
better, even, than a ripe fig. It is a fruit which I do
not know the name of, in fact I am not quite sure
that it has a name, except in some language which we
would neither of us understand. But you know what
an arum lily is, and in those forests that I told you of
there is a kind of arum lily which climbs up trees, for
there are climbing lilies there as well as climbing
palm-trees. This climbing arum lily has a red fruit,
and it is this red fruit which the Red Bird of Paradise
thinks so exceedingly nice. It will go anywhere to
get that fruit, and the naked black man with frizzly
hair knows that it will; so he makes a trap for it with
the very fruit that it is so fond of.</p>

<p>But besides the fruit, two other things are necessary
for making this trap; one of them is a forked
stick like the handle of a catapult, and the other is
some string. The Papuan soon cuts the stick, either
with a knife that he has bought of a white man, or
with a sharp piece of stone or flint, and the string he
makes from some creeper, or by rolling the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
bark of a tree between his hands. When he has
done this he takes the fruit and ties it to the forked
stick, then he climbs up a tree that he knows the Red
Birds of Paradise come to perch on, and ties the stick,
with the fruit fastened to it, to one of the branches.
To do this he takes a very long piece of string, one
end of which hangs right down to the ground, and
he ties it so cleverly that he has only to pull the
string for the stick, with the fruit on it, to come
away from the branch, just as a sash that is tied in a
bow will come undone when you pull one of the
ends. Then the black Papuan climbs down from the
tree, again, and sits underneath it with the end of the
long string in his hand, all ready to pull it when
the right time comes.</p>

<p>Sometimes it will not be long before a Red Bird of
Paradise comes to the tree, sometimes the Papuan will
have to sit there the whole day or even for two or three
days, for he is very patient and will not go away till
he has done what he came to do. All savages are
like that; they are ever so much more patient than
civilised people who wear clothes. But whenever the
poor Red Bird of Paradise does come, he is sure to see
the fruit, and then he is sure to fly to it, to eat it,
and <i>then</i> he is sure to get caught in the string. For
the string has a noose in it which gets round his
legs, and the frizzly-haired man underneath, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
watching the Bird of Paradise all the time, just pulls
the cord, and down he comes as well as the stick.
You see he cannot fly very well with the stick
fastened to him, and, however much he tries to, it is
no use, for the black man has only to keep pulling
the string.</p>

<p>That is how the poor Red Bird of Paradise is caught,
and as soon as he has caught him the black frizzly-haired
man kills him and skins him&mdash;I need hardly
tell you that he does that, for you know in whose service
he is. Then the black man takes the skin to
a yellow man, who buys it of him and cheats him
a little, and the yellow man takes it to a white man
who buys it of <i>him</i> and cheats <i>him</i> more, and it all
happens just the same as it did with the Great Bird of
Paradise, until the skin is lying on the floor of the
warehouse, with all those other beautiful skins of poor
beautiful birds&mdash;all killed to be put into the hats of
women whose hearts the wicked little demon has
frozen. Is it not shocking? But you know how to
stop it. You have only to make your mother
promise&mdash;yes, <i>promise</i>&mdash;<i>never</i> to wear a hat that has
the skin or any of the feathers of a Red Bird of
Paradise in it. Make her promise this before reading
the next chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
The Lesser, Black, Blue, and Golden
Birds of Paradise</h2>


<p>Now I have told you about two very beautiful
Birds of Paradise, and in this chapter I shall tell you
about some others; at least I shall try to tell you
what they are like, because not so very much is
known about their habits, what they do, or how
they live. That is because they live in such wild
parts of the world, in such deep, dense forests, and
on such high, steep hills. Not many travellers have
been into these out-of-the-way places, and those that
have gone there, instead of trying to watch them
and find out all about them&mdash;which would have been
so interesting&mdash;have shot at them with their guns
whenever they have seen them, and have either killed
them or driven them away. It is not by killing
birds or by driving them away that you can find out
much about their habits.</p>

<p>It would be much better if these travellers were
to take a good pair of glasses and were to sit down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
in the forests or on the hills and watch the birds
through the glasses whenever they saw them; for
with a good pair of glasses one can watch birds
even when they do not come very near to one.
Then we should know something about them, and
the more we know about a bird or any other living
creature the more interesting it becomes for us.
One cannot be <i>very</i> interested in something that
one knows nothing about, but as one begins to
know even a little about it, it begins to get interesting
directly. But then, why is it that the
travellers who go out to these countries take guns
with them instead of glasses, and shoot the birds&mdash;as
well as other animals&mdash;instead of watching
them? That is a question which I cannot answer.
All I can tell you is that it is as I say, and I am
afraid the wicked little demon has something to do
with it. But now we must get on, and first we come
to the Lesser Bird of Paradise.</p>

<p>The Lesser Bird of Paradise is something like the
Great Bird of Paradise, only it is not quite so handsome
and not nearly so big&mdash;which, of course, is
what you would expect from its name. Where the
Great Bird of Paradise is brown the lesser one is
brown too, but it is a lighter brown, not such a nice,
rich, coffee-coloured one as the other, and, on the
breast, this brown colour does not change into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
blackish-violet or a browny-purple as you know it
does in the Great Bird of Paradise&mdash;it is brown there
just the same. On the back, though, the Lesser Bird
of Paradise is all yellow, so that here, if you remember,
it has the advantage; but then the long
plumes on each side under the wings are not <i>so</i> long
as in the Great Bird of Paradise, and they have only
just a tinge of orange in them, instead of being of
the beautiful golden-orange colour that <i>his</i> ones are.
The tips of them, too, are white instead of mauvy-brown,
and the two funny feathers in the tail are
much shorter than the Great Bird of Paradise's funny
feathers.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LESSER BIRD OF PARADISE</p></div>
</div>

<p>But although the Lesser Bird of Paradise is not
such a beautiful bird as the Great Bird of Paradise is,
still it is a very beautiful bird indeed&mdash;what Bird of
Paradise is not?&mdash;and as it is commoner than the
other Birds of Paradise and easier to get, it is the one
that is most often killed and put into the hats that
the women with the frozen hearts wear; which is
why I want you to jump up and throw your arms
round your mother's neck and make her promise
never, never to wear a hat that has a Lesser Bird of
Paradise in it.</p>

<p>And now, what would you say to a Black Bird
of Paradise? For there is one&mdash;yes, and such a
splendid bird. &ldquo;Oh, but,&rdquo; you will say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span> &ldquo;if he is
black he cannot be so <i>very</i> beautiful, for he cannot
be of all sorts of beautiful colours like the other
ones.&rdquo; But have you not heard of a black diamond?
That is black, but <i>in</i> its blackness all sorts of
wonderful colours are lying asleep, and sometimes
they wake up and flash out of it, as the sun's rays
do out of a dark, stormy cloud, and then they go
back into it again and are lost, as the sun's rays are
lost when the sun goes in. Yes, they are asleep,
those colours, and whilst they are asleep the diamond
is really black, but when they wake up and begin
to gleam and flash, and sparkle, and shoot about,
then it is not a <i>black</i> diamond any more, although
we may call it so.</p>

<p>And there may be a dark, deep cavern, so dark
and so deep that you would be quite afraid to go
into it, especially at night. But some gipsies, who
were not afraid, have gone into it and have lighted
a fire, and the flames leap up and glimmer through
the smoke, and then sink for a moment and shoot
up again, and fall on the sides and roof of the
cavern, and make a deep glow in its mouth, and
flicker on the leaves of the trees outside, and send
out long tongues of flame that make a red light
in the air and lick the darkness off everything that
they touch. That cavern <i>was</i> dark and black before
the fire was lighted in it, and when the fire goes out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
it will be dark and black again, but it is not dark
and black just now, whilst the red fire is burning.</p>

<p>Or it may be a dark night, very dark and stormy,
so dark that it is difficult for people who are out in
it to find their way, whilst people who only look
out of the window, say that it is a pitch-dark night.
But now the rain is beginning to fall, and it comes
down faster and faster, and there is a muttering in
the dull sky, and, all at once, a flash of lightning
leaps out of the darkness, cutting it as though with
a red, jagged knife, and for an instant it is day,
and you see the leaves on the trees, and the rain-drops
falling through the air, and the fields with
haystacks standing in them, or rivers winding through
them, and the distant hills, and the line where the
earth meets the heavens. Then, all in a moment&mdash;almost
before you can say &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and quite
before the great clap of thunder that follows the
lightning-flash&mdash;it is night&mdash;deep, dark, black night&mdash;again.
The night in which there is a storm like
that is a dark night, but it is not dark when the
lightning is leaping and flashing.</p>

<p>It is the same with this Black Bird of Paradise.
At first when you look at him, all his plumage is
of a deep, dark, velvety black, a lovely black, a
beautiful, smooth, glossy black, a black that seems
almost to gleam and to sparkle as if it were jewellery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>&mdash;black
velvet jewellery you may call it, very
handsome, very beautiful indeed. Still it is black,
but all at once all the colours that have lain asleep
in it&mdash;blues and greens, and bluey-greens and greeny-blues,
and purples and indigos, and wonderful bronzy
reflections&mdash;wake up together, and flash out of it
like the sparkles out of the diamond, like the
tongues of fire out of the black cavern, like the
lightning out of the dark night. There they all
are, flashing and leaping about, meeting and mingling,
then shooting apart, playing little games with
each other, till all at once they fall asleep again, and
there is only the smooth, glossy black, the deep,
jetty black, the shining, gleaming, satiny-velvety
black, the black velvet, black satin jewellery. That
is what a Black Bird of Paradise is like, like a black
diamond, like a cavern with a fire lighted in it, like
a dark night with flashes of lightning.</p>

<p>But now I will tell you a little more about his
appearance, for this that I have told you is only
just to give you an idea of how that wonderful
material, from which Dame Nature with her scissors
cuts out all her children (for all things that are
alive are the children of Dame Nature), can be
black, and yet have all sorts of colours in it at the
same time.</p>

<p>First, you must know&mdash;so as not to make any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
mistake&mdash;that this &ldquo;Black Bird of Paradise&rdquo; has
another name&mdash;indeed he has two other names, but
one of them is in Latin, so we won't bother about
that. There are some birds that have no English
names, and when we come to them we will have to
call them by their Latin ones&mdash;but as long as a bird
has an English name we will never trouble our heads
about what its Latin name may be, not we, any
more than the bird itself does, and no bird that has
an English name ever thinks about what its name
is in Latin&mdash;in fact I really do not believe that it
knows. An English name is enough for <i>any</i> bird,
if only it is so <i>fortunate</i> as to have one. Now this
bird is so fortunate as to have two English names&mdash;the
Black Bird of Paradise, that you know about&mdash;which
is what the English people who live in its
own country call it&mdash;and the Superb Bird of Paradise,
which is what naturalists at home in England call it.
The <i>Superb</i> Bird of Paradise! Just fancy having
a name like that! Supposing a gentleman&mdash;some
friend of your father and mother, who calls sometimes
at the house&mdash;were to be called the superb
Mr. Jones or the superb Mr. Robinson! Only he
would have to be very much more handsome than
he is at all likely to be, before he would deserve a
name like <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>Well, the two most wonderful things about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
Superb or Black Bird of Paradise&mdash;after his marvellous
black plumage, that has all sorts of colours
lying asleep in it&mdash;are two wonderful ornaments
that he has, one on his head and one on his breast.
The one on his head is the most wonderful. It is
a sort of crest&mdash;at least I think that is the best
name for it. Some people, I know, call it a shield,
but then that is what they call the other wonderful
thing on the breast too; so, if they call that a shield,
I think they should call this a helmet, for it is a
helmet, and not a shield, that soldiers wear on the
head. <i>I</i> shall call it a crest, but it is one of the
most extraordinary crests that any bird ever had.
It is like a pair of black velvet lappets, so long
that they go all down the back and reach half-an-inch
beyond the tips of the wings. But at the back
of the head, where this crest begins, the two lappets
meet, and they are joined together for a little way
before they begin to go apart. I tell you what
will give you an idea of the shape of this crest.
Have you ever seen a pair of trousers that have
been washed, and are hanging out on a clothes-line
to dry, with the legs very wide apart, so wide they
look as if they had been stretched?&mdash;I don't know
if they really have. Of course you have seen such
a thing. Well, that will give you an idea&mdash;mind,
that is <i>all</i> I can say&mdash;of what this wonderful crest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
that is worn by the Black Bird of Paradise is like.
The legs of the trousers are the two lappets, from
where they are divided from each other, and, farther
up, they join and become all one, just as the legs
of a pair of trousers <i>do</i>. Only, of course, I need
hardly tell you that a crest of beautiful, black,
velvety feathers, glossed with bronze and purple,
has a far more <i>elegant</i> appearance than a pair of
trousers hanging out to dry, though it may have
just a <i>little</i> the same shape.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Illo_77" id="Illo_77"></a>
<img src="images/illo_077.jpg" width="581" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">KING BIRD OF PARADISE</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now I think you will agree with me that this crest
is a wonderful thing, even when it is only lying down
along the neck and body of the bird. But what
would you say when you saw the Black Bird of
Paradise lift it right up above its head?&mdash;which is
what he does, you may be sure, when he wants to
show off before the hen bird, who has no crest on
<i>her</i> head nor shield on her breast, and whose black
feathers, I am afraid, are not nearly so glossy and
velvety, and have no colours lying asleep in them
and ready to wake up all of a sudden. Ah, you
would think the Black Bird of Paradise a wonderful,
wonderful bird if you were to see him bowing politely
to his hen and lifting up his wonderful, wonderful
crest to her.</p>

<p>But I told you this bird had a shield too, and when
he lifts up his crest over his head, he shoots out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
shield in front of his breast, at the same time, and
this shield is something of the same shape as the
crest or helmet, only smaller, and always of a lovely
bluey-green colour, with a glossy sheen upon it that
is just like that upon satin. Yes, <i>always</i>, for the
colours that go to sleep in the other parts of the
Black Bird of Paradise's plumage, keep wide awake in
the shield on its breast, or, if you ever do catch them
napping, it is only just for a single instant, and then
out they flash again, wider awake than ever. So
now, if you were to say&mdash;as I am sure you would
say&mdash;that the Black Bird of Paradise was a wonderful,
wonderful bird, even if you were to see him with only
his crest lifted up, what, ah, <i>what</i> would you say if
you were to see him with his crest lifted up and his
shield shot out at the same time? Why, I think
that then you could not say less than that he was a
wonderful, wonderful, <i>wonderful</i> bird&mdash;three wonderfuls
instead of only two. And indeed you would be
right.</p>

<p>Yes, he is a wonder, is the Black Bird of Paradise,
though I must tell you that he has not any of those
long, silky feathers that hang down like cascades and
shoot up like fountains, from the sides of those other
Birds of Paradise I have been telling you about.
And he has no long &ldquo;funny feathers&rdquo; in his tail
either. You see he cannot have everything, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
crest and shield are instead of those. They are not
quite so beautiful, perhaps, but I think they are
still more wonderful. Even when his crest&mdash;his
helmet&mdash;is laid down and his shield is not stuck out,
the Black Bird of Paradise is a wonder, but when he
raises the one up and shoots the other out, both at the
same time, and says to the hen, &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; and
all the colours that have been asleep in the helmet,
or awake in the shield, gleam and flash and
sparkle together, ah, <i>then</i> he is a wonder of
wonders.</p>

<p>Then, do you think he is a bird that ought to be
killed and killed and killed, only to have those beautiful,
bronzy-black crests, and satiny-green, gleaming
shields of his set in hats where they soon get dull
and dusty, and where he can never raise them up or
shoot them out or pay proper attention to them&mdash;because
he is dead, dead, dead? Is he to be killed
and killed till he is gone for ever, and there is not
one more beautiful Black Bird of Paradise in the
whole world? Oh no, no, no; it ought not to be so&mdash;it
must not, it <i>shall</i> not&mdash;because you will prevent
it&mdash;yes, you. You will turn to your mother now,
this minute, if she is there, if she is reading this to
you, or, if not, you will run to her&mdash;oh, so quickly,
so quickly&mdash;and ask her, beg her&mdash;keep on asking and
asking, begging and begging her to promise&mdash;till she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
<i>has</i> promised&mdash;never, <i>never</i> to buy a hat that has a
beautiful Black Bird of Paradise in it.</p>

<p>Now, as I have said that the Black Bird of Paradise
is such a very wonderful bird&mdash;as I have even called
him a &ldquo;wonder of wonders&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps you will think
that there is no other Bird of Paradise quite so
wonderful as he is. Well, I do not wonder at your
thinking so; and, do you know, whilst I was describing
him to you and telling you how wonderful he
was, I thought so too. But I had forgotten the Blue
Bird of Paradise.</p>

<p>The Blue Bird of Paradise is quite as wonderful
as the Black one. Perhaps&mdash;but mind I only say
perhaps&mdash;he is even a little more wonderful. To
begin with, blue is a very uncommon colour for a
Bird of Paradise to be of. None of the Birds of
Paradise that I have told you about have feathers
that are really blue. There are blue lights, I know, in
some of their feathers, especially on the head, but still
they are not quite blue. You could hardly call them
blue feathers, for there is a green light or a purple
light as well as a blue light in them, which makes
them bluey-green or greeny purple, or, at any rate,
green or purple <i>and</i> blue, not just blue by itself.
And then, as you know, sometimes all those lights
go to sleep and then the feathers are black. I do
not think there is any Bird of Paradise except the Blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
Bird of Paradise whose feathers are really and truly
blue, and I am quite sure that there is no other one&mdash;at
least that we know of&mdash;which has so much blue
about it, that you would think of it as a blue bird, or
that has blue feather-fountains&mdash;those wonderful long
silky plumes that grow out of each side under the
wings.</p>

<p>That is what is most wonderful in the Blue Bird
of Paradise. There is no other Bird of Paradise that
can sit under a blue fountain or look out of a blue
sunset. But the plumes of the Blue Bird of Paradise
are not so long as those of the Great or the Lesser
Bird of Paradise, and when he spreads them out they
go more on each side of him than up over his head,
and, for this reason, I think, he looks more as if he
was looking out of a sunset than sitting under a
fountain. You have seen a beautiful sunset often;
there will be blue in it somewhere, cool, lovely lakes
or bays, or long, stretching inlets, of the loveliest,
purest, most delicate blue. But the clouds that float
in those bays and lakes like islands, or that shut them
in and make their shores, like great burning continents,
are not blue, but rosy red or fiery crimson or
molten gold or golden-crimson flame. That, at
least, is what the brightest ones are like, those that
are gathered nearest round the sun. Now, if they
could keep all their brightness and glowingness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
be blue instead of rose or crimson or gold, then it
would be a blue sunset; and that is what the sunset
is like that the Blue Bird of Paradise looks out of,
when he spreads out his plumes, just as the sunset
that the Red Bird of Paradise looks out of, when <i>he</i>
spreads out <i>his</i> plumes, is like a red sunset&mdash;only of
feathers, of course. One is a blue feather-sunset,
and the other a red feather-sunset.</p>

<p>And how soft those feathers are, those wonderful,
blue sunset-feathers of the wonderful Blue Bird of
Paradise. Oh, I cannot tell you how softly they
droop down over his breast, or how softly&mdash;how <i>very</i>
softly&mdash;each feather touches the other one, upon it.
How softly, I wonder&mdash;for I know you will want me
to say. As softly as a snowflake falls upon snow?
Oh, more softly than that. As softly as two
gossamers are blown together in the air? Still more
softly, even. As softly, then, as your mother kisses
you when you are asleep, and she does not wish to
wake you? Yes, I think it is as softly, or almost as
softly, as that. Those are two of the very softest
kisses&mdash;when your mother kisses you when you are
asleep, so as not to wake you, and when the soft blue
feathers of the plumes on each side of a Blue Bird of
Paradise, meet and kiss each other on its breast.</p>

<p>Now that is all I am going to tell you about the
front part of the Blue Bird of Paradise&mdash;for those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
wonderful blue feathers that grow on each side
become the front part of him when he spreads them
out. You see, they open out like two fans, with the
handles turned towards each other, and meet together
on the breast and above the head, so as to
make one large fan or screen. Of course there is
something behind this screen, and through it peeps
the head of the bird, which is very pretty too. But
you don't look at his head, you don't seem to see it.
All you see or look at are those beautiful, beautiful
plumes, that lovely screen, that wonderful soft
blue feather-sunset.</p>

<p>As for the back part of this wonderful Blue Bird
of Paradise, well, that is blue too, most of it&mdash;a
handsome blue, a lovely blue, a gleaming, shining,
glossy, satiny blue that looks darker when you see it
from one side, and lighter when you see it from
another, and which gleams and glints and is very
resplendent (which is a word your mother will
explain to you) however you look at it. Oh, a
glorious blue, a magnificent blue, but not <i>such</i> a blue
as the blue of those soft lovely feathers that spread
out on each side and curl over and meet and kiss
each other so softly, on the breast. And the head
and neck of the Blue Bird of Paradise (for sometimes
he puts them behind the screen, and then they
are the back part of him) are of a soft velvet brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
that, as you look at it, becomes a soft velvet-claret-magenta
colour (which your mother knows all about
and will explain to you), and in his tail there are two
long &ldquo;funny feathers&rdquo; that hang down from the
bough he is sitting on, and&mdash;and <i>now</i> you must try
to imagine him. <i>When</i> you have imagined him&mdash;or
before you have, if you are not able to&mdash;you must
make your mother promise&mdash;now what? You know,
of course. You must make her promise <i>never</i> to
wear a hat with a Blue Bird of Paradise's feathers
in it.</p>

<p>Now we come to the Golden or Six-shafted Bird
of Paradise, who lives just in one part of New Guinea&mdash;that
long part at the north that goes out into the
sea, and which we call a peninsula; you have only to
look at the map and you will see it. Now I think
of it, the Superb or Black Bird of Paradise&mdash;or shall
we say the Superb Black Bird of Paradise?&mdash;lives
there too, so I daresay they sometimes see each other.
Perhaps they call on each other, for, you see, they
are both of them distinguished. One is superb and
the other golden, and when two people are like that
they do not mind calling upon one another. You
see, neither of them can be hurt by it then. A <i>superb</i>
person may call upon even a <i>golden</i> person, and yet feel
quite well after it, and it will not do a <i>golden</i> person
any harm at all to call upon a <i>superb</i> person. So, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
birds are like people, I feel sure that sometimes the
Golden and the Superb Bird of Paradise call upon
each other.</p>

<p>Now you will want to know why this Bird of
Paradise is called both the Golden and the Six-shafted
Bird of Paradise. Well, he is called the
Golden Bird of Paradise because he has lovely golden
feathers on his throat and breast, and he is called the
Six-shafted Bird of Paradise because six little arrows&mdash;for
that is what they look like&mdash;seem to have been
shot into his head, three on each side&mdash;arrows, you
know, are sometimes called shafts. These little
shafts or arrows are six inches long&mdash;almost as long
as the bird itself&mdash;and bend right back over his body,
as far as to the tail. Of course each of them is
really a feather&mdash;an arrow that is all feather&mdash;but it
is a &ldquo;funny feather&rdquo; with only the quill, which is
very thin and slender, till quite the end, where there
is just a little oval piece of the soft web&mdash;the part
that looks really like a feather&mdash;left upon it. That
is what makes them look like arrows. But is it not
curious that the &ldquo;funny feathers&rdquo; of <i>this</i> Bird of
Paradise are in his head instead of in his tail?
I think it must be because Dame Nature wanted to
make him a little different.</p>

<p>Of course you will see at once that six feathers
like that&mdash;to say nothing of his wonderful golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
breast&mdash;make the Six-shafted (or Golden) Bird of
Paradise quite as remarkable as the Black or the
Blue, or any of the other, Birds of Paradise. Whether
it makes him <i>more</i> remarkable, that I really can't
say. <i>You</i> must make up your mind about that.
The fact is, <i>all</i> the Birds of Paradise are remarkable.
I am sure if they were all together in one place, and
you were to say out loud that any one of them was
the <i>most</i> remarkable, all the other ones would be very
much offended.</p>

<p>But now, besides his six little shafts or arrows and
the beautiful golden feathers on his throat and breast&mdash;they
are very large, I must tell you, those feathers,
and sometimes they look green and blue as well as
golden&mdash;this Bird of Paradise has two immense tufts
of beautiful, soft, silky feathers on each side of the
breast. So large each tuft is, that when he lifts
them both up&mdash;as of course he can do&mdash;they almost
hide him altogether. Then on the back of his head
he has a band of feathers, so wonderfully bright that
they do not seem to be feathers at all. They look
more like jewels&mdash;yes, jewels. It is as if some magician
had taken the sheen and shining light out of the
emerald and topaz, and put them on that bird's head,
and told them to stay there. Then on his forehead,
just above the beak&mdash;as if all this were not enough&mdash;there
is a patch, quite a large patch, of pure white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
feathers that shine like satin. Really I think you
might almost say that this Bird of Paradise was <i>the</i>
most wonderful of all the Birds of Paradise. But
take care, do not say it out loud or you will offend
<i>all</i> the others. Only I forgot, they are not here.
Well, then, you <i>may</i> say it out loud, if you really
think so. I do wish I could have got this bird's
picture, but as he would not give it me, you must
look at the picture of the Golden-winged Bird of
Paradise instead. <i>He</i> is a very handsome bird, too&mdash;very
much brighter than he looks.</p>

<p>Well, this makes the sixth Bird of Paradise which
I have been able to tell you something about&mdash;I mean
about their appearance, for very little else is known
about them. But, do you know, there are some forty
or fifty different kinds, and, of course, if I were to
describe them all, or anything like all (which, however, I
should not be able to do), this little book would become
quite a big book, and there would be no room in it for
any other kinds of beautiful birds. So I won't describe
any more Birds of Paradise, but I will just say something,
before getting on to the other beautiful birds,
about Birds of Paradise and beautiful birds in general.
That means about most Birds of Paradise and most
other beautiful birds. When we talk about things
in general, or people in general, we mean most things
or most people. But that must be in another chapter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
for this one has been quite long enough, and so we
must end it. Oh, but wait a minute. Really, I was
quite forgetting. First you must get your mother
to promise never to buy a hat in which there are any
feathers belonging to the Golden or Six-shafted Bird
of Paradise. Yes, and never to wear it either, even
if she did not buy it, but had it given to her. Of
course your father might give your mother a hat,
but if he were to give her one of that sort, he would
have to take it back to the shop and change it for
another.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
About all Birds of Paradise, and Some
Explanations</h2>


<p>As I have told you, there are some forty or fifty
different kinds of Birds of Paradise, and they are all
of them as beautiful, or nearly as beautiful, as those
that I have described, each one in its own special
way. Of course you must know yourself, or your
mother will tell you, that all this wonderful beauty
has not been given to these birds for nothing, and I
have told you that the male Birds of Paradise, who
alone have it, show it off to the poor hen birds, whose
plumage is quite sober in comparison&mdash;though you
must not think that <i>they</i> are not pretty birds too&mdash;because
they are pretty, though in a quieter style. So
they are not <i>really</i> &ldquo;poor&rdquo; hen birds, that is only
just a way of speaking. They are happy enough,
you may be sure, for they have their husbands' fine
clothes to look at. But what is so interesting, is
that each of these different kinds of Birds of Paradise
has some different way of arranging and showing off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
his fine clothes&mdash;for, of course, a bird's feathers are his
clothes just as much as our coats and dresses are ours.
And, besides that, each one of them puts himself into
some peculiar attitude, which he thinks is the best one
to let his plumage be seen as he would like it to be.
We may be quite sure of this, because it is what all
birds do that have beautiful plumage; and many of
them have regular places that they come to, to run
or jump about in, just as soldiers come into a park
or common to march about in it, and show off their
nice pretty uniforms. There will always be a great
many hen birds round these places, to look at the
beautiful males, and there are always a great many
ladies round the park or common, to look at the
beautiful soldiers.</p>

<p>Now, would it not be interesting if we knew what
all these different Birds of Paradise did, and how they
arranged their plumage, and what attitudes they went
into, and whether they ran or jumped or flew or did
all three, and all the rest of it? If only there was
somebody who knew all that, I think he could write a
very interesting book, and if only some one would go
out into those countries, with a pair of glasses (or even
a pair of eyes) instead of with a gun, and whenever he
saw a Bird of Paradise would just look at it through
the glasses (or with his own eyes, if it was near enough)
instead of shooting it, I think <i>he</i> might write an inte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>resting
book. I am sure <i>I</i> should find it interesting,
and I <i>think</i> you would too. Depend upon it, if any one
could tell people what a Bird of Paradise did, he would
interest them very much more than by telling them
how he shot it. That is not at all interesting, how
he shot it. Do you think it would be so <i>very</i> interesting
for people to know how you broke a very
handsome ornament in your mother's drawing-room?
Why, I don't think it would interest even your
mother&mdash;much; but she would be very sorry you
broke it. And that is just how <i>I</i> feel (and I think
some other people do too) when a person tells me
how he shot a Bird of Paradise. Things of that
kind interest the little demon. If they interest any
one else, I am afraid it is only <i>because</i> of that little
demon, because of his wicked powders and his having
sent the Goddess of Pity to sleep.</p>

<p>But I am sorry to say that there is hardly anybody
who knows anything about all these Birds of Paradise,
anything about their habits and how they live and
how they dance and the way they arrange their
wonderful plumage, so as to make it look as beautiful
as possible. Perhaps there are a few people who
know just a little&mdash;a <i>very</i> little&mdash;about some of the
more common kinds, but as for all the rest, if any
one knows anything about them, it must be those
black or yellow people that we call savages, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
live in the same countries that they live in. That
is because, when a traveller from Europe goes out
to those countries he always takes a gun&mdash;not glasses
(or if he does take a pair of glasses he does not use
them, or his eyes either, in the right way), and when
he sees one of these rare Birds of Paradise, he shoots
it, or else frightens it away, as I told you. Then,
when he comes back, he writes his book and tells
you how he shot it, or tried to shoot it, and then
he says: &ldquo;Unfortunately, nothing whatever is known
of the habits of this species.&rdquo; It is not very wonderful
that <i>he</i> knows nothing of them, is it? And yet
this traveller, with his gun, almost always calls himself
a <i>naturalist</i>. Now a <i>real</i> naturalist is a person who
loves nature. But is not that a funny way to love
her&mdash;to shoot her children? Depend upon it, that
one of those little bottles that the demon keeps his
powders in, is labelled &ldquo;Natural History&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love
of Nature.&rdquo; You know that <i>his</i> bottles have generally
a false label on them.</p>

<p>So, I am afraid I cannot tell you much about
what the Birds of Paradise do, or how they show off
their beautiful feathers. Indeed, it is very much
the same with most other beautiful birds, and for
the very same reason that I have been telling you,
because people <i>will</i> shoot, instead of looking and
watching. Just the little that we know about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
Great Bird of Paradise, how he has a special tree
that he comes to, to have those dances that the
natives call &ldquo;Scalelis,&rdquo; and how he flies about with
his plumes waving, or sits underneath them as if he
were in the spray of a falling fountain, that I have
told you; but, besides this, I can only tell you just
a very little about a Bird of Paradise that I have
not said anything about, because, you know, there
are so many of them. The little I can tell you is
this. Two gentlemen&mdash;one of them a Mr. Chalmers
and the other a Mr. Wyatt&mdash;were once travelling
in the part of New Guinea where this Bird of
Paradise lives, and one morning, when they were
up early, they saw four of the cock birds and two
of the hens, in a tree close by them. This is what
one of these gentlemen says about them (if there
is any word too long for you, or that you don't
understand, you must ask your mother to explain
it):&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two hens were sitting quietly on a branch,
and the four cocks, dressed in their very best, their
ruffs of green and yellow standing out, giving them a
handsome appearance about the head and neck&rdquo; (yes,
I feel sure of that), &ldquo;their long flowing plumes so
arranged that every feather seemed combed out, and
the long wires&rdquo; (he means the &ldquo;funny feathers&rdquo;)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
&ldquo;stretched well out behind, were dancing in a circle
round them.&rdquo; (Just fancy!) &ldquo;It was an interesting
sight.&rdquo; (I should <i>think</i> so!) &ldquo;First one and then
another would advance a little nearer to a hen, and
she, coquette-like&rdquo; (you will have to ask your mother
what <i>that</i> means), &ldquo;would retire a little, pretending
not to care for any advances. A shot was fired, contrary
to our expressed wish, there was a strange
commotion, and two of the cocks flew away&rdquo; (you
see what shooting does), &ldquo;but the others and the hens
remained. Soon the two returned, and again the
dance began, and continued long. As we had strictly
forbidden any more shooting, all fear was gone; and
so, after a rest, the males came a little nearer to the
dark brown hens. Quarrelling ensued, and in the end
all six birds flew away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fancy seeing all that! I think it is wonderful that
any of the birds stayed after the shot had been fired,
and if another one had been, no doubt they would
all have gone. Those travellers, you see, were a little
better than most travellers are. They did not kill
the birds (perhaps <i>they</i> were <i>not</i> naturalists), and the
consequence is they have had something interesting
to tell us about them. Still, I think if I had been
there I should have had a <i>little</i> more to say, and
instead of just saying that the cock birds were dancing,
I should have described <i>how</i> they were dancing,
and what sort of attitudes they put themselves into.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
And I think I would have waited at that place, and
gone to those trees again very early next morning, all
by myself, to see if those birds came back to dance
there. Still, what these travellers do tell us is very
interesting, very much more interesting than if they
had only written, &ldquo;Here we shot,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Here we
obtained another specimen of Paradisea Something-elsea&rdquo;&mdash;which,
of course, would be the Latin name.
Naturalists like to tell us the Latin name of the
animals they shoot. If they only had an English
name I don't think they would care nearly so much
to shoot them. How sorry we ought to be that
animals have Latin names!</p>

<p>But, now, how is it that it is only the cock bird&mdash;the
male&mdash;of all these Birds of Paradise who is so
beautiful, whilst the poor hen&mdash;the female bird&mdash;is
quite plain, in comparison? Well, I must tell you,
first, that this is not only the case with Birds of Paradise,
but that it is just the same with other birds as
well. In most, if not all, of the beautiful birds I
am going to tell you about, it is the male bird that
is so <i>very</i> beautiful, so that perhaps you will begin to
think that this is the case with <i>all</i> beautiful birds,
and that there is no hen bird that has <i>very</i> splendid
or brilliant plumage. But this is not so at all. You
would make a great mistake if you were to think
that. In most of the parrots&mdash;those brightly-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>coloured
birds that you know so well&mdash;the male and
female are alike, and if you were to see a kingfisher&mdash;the
star-bird that I told you about in the first
chapter&mdash;gleaming and glancing up a river, you would
not know whether it was the one or the other. The
feathers of the female scarlet flamingo are almost&mdash;if
not quite&mdash;as scarlet as those of the male; the cock
robin's breast is not more red than the breast of the
hen robin, at least you would find it difficult to tell
the difference; male and female pigeons&mdash;and some of
them are very splendid&mdash;are as bright as each other,
and so it is with a very great number of other birds.</p>

<p>Now does not this seem funny, that some male
birds should be so much handsomer than their wives,
whilst some <i>hen</i> birds should be just as handsome as
their husbands? Is there any way of explaining this,
or, rather, do we know how to explain it? for there
<i>is</i> a way of explaining everything&mdash;a right way, I
mean, of course. The difficult thing is to find it
out. Well, there are some clever people who have
been thinking about this funny thing, and they try to
explain it in this way.</p>

<p>Of course, when the male Birds of Paradise (and
it is the same with other birds) show off their fine
plumage to the hen birds, it is because they want to
marry them, which is just the same as with people;
for, you know, when a gentleman wishes to marry a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
lady he dresses as nicely as he can, and sometimes he
goes into attitudes as well. Now, the hen Birds of
Paradise&mdash;so these clever people say&mdash;always choose
for their husbands the birds that have the finest
feathers, and the other ones, whose feathers are not
so fine, have to look about for another wife. Of
course, after the Birds of Paradise have married, they
make a nest, and very soon there are eggs in it, and
then the eggs are chipped and little Birds of Paradise
come out of them. Some of these little Birds of
Paradise will be males and some females, and the
male ones will grow up with feathers like the cock
birds, and the females with feathers like the hen&mdash;just
as with us, the boys sometimes grow up like the
father, and the girls sometimes grow up like the
mother&mdash;only with Birds of Paradise it is always so.
But now, amongst these young Birds of Paradise,
though all will be beautiful, some will be more beautiful
than the others, more beautiful even than their
father, perhaps, and you may be sure that those will
be the ones who will find it most easy to marry, and
who will have the greater number of children. Some
of those children will be more beautiful than <i>their</i>
fathers, and then <i>they</i> will marry and have children
that are still more beautiful than themselves, and so it
will always be going on. The young male Birds of
Paradise will always have feathers like their fathers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
and gradually they will get more and more beautiful,
because their wives will always choose them for their
beauty. But the young female Birds of Paradise
will always be like their mothers, and will not become
more beautiful than they are, because hen Birds
of Paradise are not chosen for their beauty, but only
for their good qualities.</p>

<p>Now, if this is true, it shows how sensible the Birds
of Paradise must be, for all <i>sensible</i> persons would
choose their wives for their good qualities, and not
just for their beauty. The worst of it is that there
are so many <i>persons</i> who are not <i>quite</i> sensible. Still,
even with us, there are a good many wives who must,
I think, have been chosen, like the hen Birds of Paradise,
for their good qualities&mdash;which, of course, is what
they <i>ought</i> to be chosen for.</p>

<p>That is how some people explain why the male
Birds of Paradise, and other beautiful male birds, are
so much more beautiful than the females. They say
that they have gradually got more and more beautiful,
whilst the hens have remained plain, and that once
upon a time there was not so very much difference
between them. And if you ask them why the males
and females of other birds are both as beautiful as
each other, they will tell you that the children of
<i>those</i> birds were always like the father, so that, as the
father birds became beautiful&mdash;for they were chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
in the same way&mdash;all the little daughter birds became
beautiful too, as well as the little sons.</p>

<p>But I am afraid the people who explain it all
in this way must have forgotten how the Birds of
Paradise, at any rate, used once to live in Paradise,
where, of course, they were all as beautiful as each
other, and though their plumage got spoilt when they
came out of it (beautiful though it seems to us) in
the way I told you, yet it does seem funny that the
hens should have had it spoilt so much more than the
cock birds. But you know it was spoilt by the glory
which streamed out of the gates of Paradise, and
which was so bright and burning that it burnt off all
the most beautiful parts of it, and scorched and
singed the rest. Now, of course, the nearer any bird
was to the gate of Paradise when it opened, the worse
he would have got scorched, and so if the cocks flew
faster than the hens&mdash;and I am sure they did&mdash;they
would have got soonest away, and the hens would
have suffered most. <i>That</i> explanation seems much
more simple; but, you see, these <i>clever</i> people do not
believe about the Birds of Paradise having once lived
in Paradise. They have their own explanation of it
all (which I have just told you), and they like to
believe in that. Then which of the two are you to
believe in? Well, I think the simpler one&mdash;which is
prettier as well&mdash;would be the best for you to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
in <i>now</i>, but later on&mdash;when <i>you</i> are a clever person&mdash;you
can try the other. Now, you know, you are
only a little child, and something that is simple and
pretty is the right thing for a little child. But a
clever person wants a different kind of explanation to
<i>that</i>. <i>He</i> wants a clever one, and as soon as you feel
that <i>you</i> have become a clever person, there will be a
clever explanation all ready for you.</p>

<p>But now, whilst you are still a little child, I can
give you another explanation of why the males and
females of some birds are as beautiful as each other,
whilst the males of some other ones are ever so much
the most beautiful. This other explanation will do
in case the one about the cock Birds of Paradise flying
faster than the hens is not the right one, for, of course,
we cannot be quite sure that they flew faster. I did say
I was sure, but that was just a little mistake of mine.
One is not <i>really</i> sure of a thing until one knows it,
and I don't quite <i>know</i> that it happened like that,
however much I may think it did. Besides, this new
explanation that I am going to give you will do for
all other birds as well as for the Birds of Paradise,
and, of course, the more anything explains the better
explanation it is. So now I will give it you, and, if
you like it better than the other, you can take it instead,
and if you only like it as well, then you will have two
nice explanations instead of only one. Here it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>In the old days, a long, long time ago, the males
and females of all the birds were as beautiful as each
other, and they were all in love with each other.
Only the question was which of them were the most
in love, and, as to that, they often had disputes. &ldquo;We
love you better than you love us,&rdquo; said the male birds
to the females; &ldquo;you love us only for our beauty,
you do not love us for ourselves, as we love you.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If you think so,&rdquo; said the female birds (the beautiful
hens), &ldquo;give us your beauty, and you shall find
that we love you just as well, without it.&rdquo; But the
male birds, who were quite content, <i>really</i>, to be loved
for their beauty, and who did not wish to part with it,
made haste to change the conversation. &ldquo;But <i>you</i>
love <i>us</i> for <i>our</i> beauty,&rdquo; said the hen birds (for they
soon got round again to the same subject); &ldquo;it is not
for ourselves that you love us, but only because we
are beautiful.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that is your idea,&rdquo; said the male
birds, &ldquo;bestow your beauty upon us, and you shall
soon be undeceived.&rdquo; Then the female birds, who only
wished to be loved for themselves and not for what
they looked like, gave all their beauty to their beautiful
husbands, and remained without any. So now, of
course, the male birds were twice as beautiful as they
had been before, whilst the poor hens were not
beautiful at all, and would even have been quite ugly
if they had not been birds, for a bird <i>cannot</i> be ugly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
And now it was found that, whilst some of the male
birds had loved their wives so much that they went
on loving them still, in spite of the change in their
appearance, others (and I am afraid they were the
greater number) left off loving them, as soon as they
had left off being beautiful, and were not able to love
them again, although they tried ever so hard. You
see, they had only loved them for their beauty, not
for themselves, so as soon as there was no more
beauty, there was no more love. So those male birds
who had loved for love only, and not because their
wives were beautiful, kept this beauty and added it
to their own. Their wives did not want it back
again, for love was enough for them. But the ones
who had loved their wives, only because of their
beauty, had to give it them back, for otherwise they
would not have been able to go on loving them, and
that would have been very awkward indeed. That
is why, in some birds, the males and females are as
beautiful as each other, whilst in others, the males are
twice as beautiful as the females. As I told you,
this is an explanation which does as well for any other
bird as it does for the Birds of Paradise, and, if you
like it, you can believe in it till you have grown up
from a simple little child into a complicated clever
person.</p>

<p>So now there are six Birds of Paradise that your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
mother has promised not to wear in her hats, not in
any hat that she buys or has given to her, whether
it has the whole skin of one in it, or only just a few
feathers, or even one. She will not buy such a hat,
and she will not go into a shop to ask the price of it.
She will have nothing to do with it whatever, because
she has promised.</p>

<p>But now, do you not see that, as your dear mother
has only promised about six kinds of Birds of Paradise,
and as there are some forty or fifty kinds in the
world, she might easily buy a hat that had some
kind of Bird of Paradise in it, without its being any of
these six? How much better it would be, then, if
your dear, dear mother were to promise never to wear
a hat that had any kind of Bird of Paradise in it.
And I am sure she will, now that you have explained
to her about the wicked little demon, and how much
more beautiful these Birds of Paradise are when they
are alive, and how happy they are, too, and how their
wives want them, to look at, and how there will be
no more of them left, soon, if people keep on killing
them, just to put into hats. Just talk to her about
it a little, and then throw your arms round her neck
and say: &ldquo;Oh mother, do <i>promise</i> never to wear a
hat that has the feathers of <i>any</i> Bird of Paradise in it.&rdquo;
There! And now she has promised. Well, you see
how easy it is.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
About Humming-Birds, and Some More
Explanations</h2>


<p>Perhaps, when I was telling you about the Birds
of Paradise and how very, very beautiful they are, you
thought they were the most beautiful birds in the
whole world. They are nearly, but not quite. There
are the Humming-birds&mdash;<i>they</i> are even more beautiful.
At least they are more like jewels, and the Indians
who live in the countries where they are found call
them &ldquo;living sunbeams.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&ldquo;By western Indians living sunbeams named.&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>You can remember it by that line, which is from
a poem by Mrs. Hemans, a clever lady whom your
mother will tell you about. For the Indians, you
know, live in America, that great country&mdash;so large
that we call it &ldquo;the new world&rdquo;&mdash;which Columbus
discovered. They do not live in India, as you might
think. At least, when we talk of the Indians, it is
the ones that live in America and not India that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
mean. The ones that live in India we call Hindoos.
It seems funny, but the reason of it is that when
Columbus discovered America, he thought it was
India; for it was India he had been trying to find,
and he thought he had found it. But it was
America, not India, and it is only in America that
the beautiful Humming-birds live&mdash;birds that are
so beautiful as they are want a world to themselves
to live in.</p>

<p>Now the birds that we have been talking about&mdash;the
Birds of Paradise&mdash;are not such very small birds.
The largest of them is nearly as large as a crow, and
even the very smallest is not so much smaller than a
thrush or a starling. But the largest Humming-bird
is not so large as a sparrow or chaffinch, and the
smaller ones are the very smallest birds in the
whole world, some of them being not so <i>very</i> much
larger than a large humble-bee, which is quite wonderful
to think of. Then they are wonderful fliers. The
Birds of Paradise fly very well&mdash;quite well enough&mdash;but
still there is nothing extraordinary in the way they
fly. But the little Humming-birds dart about quite
like lightning, and move their wings so fast that,
when you look at them, they do not seem to be wings
at all, but only two little hazy patches in the air, with
a bright jewel between them, which is the gleaming
breast of the Humming-bird. All the time their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
wings are moving so quickly, they make a humming
sound, just as a top does when it is spinning very fast,
which is why we call them Humming-birds, just
as we call tops that hum very much, humming-tops.</p>

<p>We have named the Humming-birds from the
sound they make when they fly, and the Indians from
their bright radiance and the speed at which they dart
about. It is from flower to flower that they dart, and
whilst you are looking at one sunbeam that is dancing
about one flower, all at once there is a ray of light
through the air, and another sunbeam is dancing about
another flower. That is what it looks like, only,
really, it is the same sunbeam that has flown from
one flower to another.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you are walking in the garden in
England and looking at the geraniums in your flowerbeds,
you will see a little brown moth hovering over
one of them, and putting a long, slender thread-like
thing that we call a proboscis (though we call an
elephant's trunk a proboscis too) right down into the
centre of the flower. <i>His</i> wings move so fast that
you can hardly see them, and in a second or two <i>he</i>
will dart away too, so quickly that you only know he
is gone, and then, all of a sudden, you will see him
again, hovering over another geranium and probing it
with his wonderful, long, thin proboscis. It is a
tube, that proboscis, and through it, the moth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
sucking up the nectar of the flower, which is what it
lives on. That moth is the humming-bird hawk-moth,
and, if you have seen it, you have seen what
looks more like a Humming-bird than anything else
in England. It hovers over or under or in front of a
flower, as the Humming-birds do, it keeps moving
its wings in the same rapid way as they move theirs,
and making the same humming noise with them, and
it puts a long, slender, little brown thing, that looks
<i>something</i> like the beak of a Humming-bird, right
down into the flower, and sucks up the nectar that is
in it, which is just what a Humming-bird does. So
if the humming-bird moth were bright and gleaming,
as Humming-birds&mdash;sunbeams&mdash;are, it would seem to
be a Humming-bird and not a moth at all. But you
must not think that it really would be one. Oh no,
it never could be, because it is an insect, and an insect
is a very different thing to a bird.</p>

<p>The humming-bird moth and the Humming-bird
look like each other because they live in the
same way and do the same things. They both
fly, so they both have wings; and they both sip nectar,
so they both have a long thing to stick into the
flowers and suck it up with: so they look like each
other, but they are not a bit the same. A petticoat,
you know, looks a little like an upper skirt,
for they both have to be worn round the waist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
which makes them the same kind of shape, and when
the skirt is part of a white dress then they are of the
same colour. But think how different they really are!
Why, one is a petticoat and the other is an upper skirt.
So you must always remember that, though two
animals look the same, they may really be very
different.</p>

<p>Now although the Humming-birds, or living sunbeams,
are all of them small birds, yet they are not all
of the same size, and some are quite big compared to
others, just as a peacock butterfly is quite big, compared
to a tiny blue one, whilst even the tiny little
blue one may be big compared to some very small
moths. Then, again, their beaks are of all kinds of
different shapes and lengths. Some are quite straight,
whilst others are bent like a sabre or even a sickle, and
one Humming-bird has his so very much bent indeed,
that it looks like half of a black ring or bracelet or
something else that is quite round. As for length,
some are shorter than a quite short pin, whilst others
are longer than a very long darning-needle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Illo_113" id="Illo_113"></a>
<img src="images/illo_113.jpg" width="507" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">RACQUET-TAILED HUMMING-BIRD</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of course there is a reason for the beaks of
Humming-birds being so different, and the reason
is that they have to go into different flowers, and
must fit into them as a finger fits into a fingerstall
or a periwinkle into its shell. If the part of
the flower that holds the nectar is straight, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
the beak of the Humming-bird that feeds on the
nectar of that flower must be straight too, but if it
is curved, then, of course, the beak must be curved,
or else how could it be pushed into it?</p>

<p>And if the nectary of any flower (for that is what
the place that the nectar is in is called) were shaped
like a corkscrew, then the beak of the Humming-bird
that sucked out the nectar from <i>that</i> flower would
have to be shaped like a corkscrew too. But there
are no flowers shaped like that, and so there are no
Humming-birds with corkscrew beaks, like the tail of
a periwinkle. But there <i>is</i> a flower that has its
nectary, or honey-tube, bent round into almost a half
circle, and it is just that one Humming-bird that has
its beak bent in the same way, that sips the nectar from
that flower. No other one is able to do it, and
there is no other flower that that Humming-bird can
sip the nectar from.</p>

<p>And there are more than 400 different kinds of
Humming-birds, and the beak of every one of them
must fit into some flower or another, and often into a
great many more than one. Oh then, what a lot
of different kinds of flowers there must be, for all
these beaks to fit into! Ah, there are indeed, for it
is in the great forests or plains of America&mdash;the
largest in the whole world&mdash;or on the slopes of the
great mountain ranges there&mdash;the highest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
world except the Himalayas&mdash;that the Humming-birds
live, and everywhere there are wonderful trees
and wonderful flowers. As for the trees, I have told
you what some of them are like in the forests of the
Malay Archipelago, and in the great forests of Brazil;
I think they are still larger and more wonderful.
And as for the flowers that grow in those wonderful
forests or on the great plains or the slopes and sides
of those great, high mountains, how could I ever
give you an idea of what they are like, or how should
I know where to begin, when there are so many?
For there are some that are like great scarlet trumpets
on the outside of their petals, but when you look inside
them they are like the open mouths of fierce dragons
shooting out a lot of fiery-orange tongues, all forked
and cloven ever so many times over, each tongue
looking as if it were the tongues of twenty little
hissing snakes, all tied together in a bundle and ready
to dart at you. And there are some that are in
bunches, and each bunch looks as if a lot of oxen had
put their heads against each other and begun to grow
smaller and smaller and smaller till their horns were
no longer than honeysuckles, and then had disappeared
altogether, <i>except</i> their horns, which had turned pink
and stayed there. Bunches of little pink ox-horns
are what those flowers look like. Then there are
flowers that look as if they had almost changed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
very beautiful butterflies, and others that seem to be
very beautiful butterflies just changing into flowers.
There are flowers that are all the colours that there
are, and others that have tried all the colours that
there are, and then found out new ones to be of.
And there are some, too, that are only white, but so
lovely that all the flowers of all the colours that there
are, gaze at them and envy them. Some are so soft
and delicate that, although you see them, you only
seem to be dreaming of them. They make you
think of heaven, and it is as if angels were kissing you.
Others are like golden stars, with a stem that is like
a long, long, very long piece of red string that goes
tying itself round and round a great many trees, and
climbing up and up them, and all the way up there
are bright green leaves and the beautiful golden stars.
Other strings are golden or green, and have pink or
crimson stars upon them, and some of these hang
down, like glowing lamps from a soft, cool, emerald
ceiling. Some flowers are like little bunches of
red counters that you play games with, and there is
one that is like a wonderful, scarlet, shining leaf,
with a thick little tail at the tip of it, twisted round
in a coil. This tail is orange with cream-white
spots upon it, but just at its <i>own</i> tip it is scarlet
again, like the rest of the leaf. Such a wonderful-looking
flower! There are creeping crimson nastur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>tiums
that make the air blush in spots, azaleas
with scarlet that has swooned into pink, and pink
that has blushed into scarlet, and calceolarias that
look like yellow flower-bubbles that fairies have
blown into the air and that have come down, softly,
upon delicate little stalks, and stayed there without
bursting. Not all of these wonderful flowers have
a scent, for scented flowers are commoner here in
England than in far-off tropical countries. But a
few of them have, and <i>their</i> scent is so exquisite
that you would think it was sent from heaven.</p>

<p>Some of the flowers have leaves that are even
more beautiful than themselves, and sometimes it is
the leaves that you look at and not the flowers at
all. Some of these leaves seem to be made of
velvet, or something even softer and more velvety <i>than</i>
velvet, whilst the colours in them are like the pattern
of a very beautiful Turkey carpet. Others look like
wonderful spear-heads or the tops of very ornamental
park railings, green and red and orange, and all
striped and spotted and speckled like the skin of
newts or lizards. There are some leaves so large,
too, that they would almost make a carpet for a
<i>very</i> small room, and so handsome that you might
go into all the haberdashers' shops in the world
without finding any carpet that would look nearly
so well. Some are still larger, and those are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
leaves of palm-trees that bend down from high in
the air, at the end of long, bending stalks that
spring from the top of the small slender stem.
They are of such a soft, lovely green that it makes
you cool even to look up at them, and so graceful
and delicate that you think of the fairies, but so
big and strong that a giant might lie upon them
and go to sleep, without breaking them or crushing
them down. And there are wonderful cactuses&mdash;so
large that they are called trees&mdash;with trunks like
great, prickly, green caterpillars, and branches like
smaller, prickly, green caterpillars stuck on to them
by the tail. But on these ugly branches there are
flowers like beautiful purple stars, whilst in the pools
or the rivers, water-lilies are floating that look like
large, purple flakes of snow. It is amongst flowers
and leaves and trees like these that the Humming-birds
fly about. Those are the wonderful goblets
out of which they sip their nectar.</p>

<p>But now, about this sipping of nectar I have
something to tell you, and when I have told it you,
you will know more than a good many people do,
who think they know something about Humming-birds
and natural history. Well, it is this: the
Humming-birds do not live <i>only</i> on the nectar in
the flowers, as most people think they do, but on
the insects that have been drowned in it, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
they suck up at the same time. You see the
insects&mdash;of course I mean little insects&mdash;flies or
gnats, not large moths and butterflies&mdash;get into the
tubes of the flowers, to sip the nectar themselves,
and they often fall into it, and are not able to get
out again, but drown there; for to them it is like
a little lake or pond&mdash;a pond of nectar, and, of
course, very nice, but still, for all that, it drowns
them. There is hardly any flower-cup that has
not these drowned insects in it, and when the
Humming-birds drink the nectar, they swallow the
little insects at the same time. They could not
live upon nectar only&mdash;they want animal food (as
it is called) as well, and that is the way in which
they get it. That is why when people have caught
Humming-birds, and given them only nectar&mdash;or
sugar and water, which is something like it&mdash;to
live on, they have always died. There are no
insects in it, no animal food. They had gravy,
you see, but no meat, and they wanted meat as
well as gravy. So they died, the poor Humming-birds.
But I think it is almost better for a living
sunbeam to die than to be kept living in a
cage.</p>

<p>But now, why do the Indians call the Humming-birds
living sunbeams? Oh, but you will say I
have told you that, and, besides, anybody could guess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
It is because they are so bright and gleaming, and
hover in the air as a sunbeam dances in it, or shoot
through it as quickly and as brightly as a sunbeam
shoots down from the sun. Well, yes, that is one
explanation; but why should there not be two (as
there were about the Birds of Paradise), so that you
can choose the one you like best?&mdash;for you know
you are not a clever person <i>yet</i>. Well, there <i>are</i>
two, for the Indians say that the Humming-birds
are called living sunbeams because they really <i>are</i>
living sunbeams, just as you are called a little
girl because you are a little girl; and how could
there be a simpler explanation of a thing than
that?</p>

<p>And this is how it happened, only you must
remember that it was a very, very long time ago.
In those old days the sun had not long sent his
beams to earth, and it was only after they came
there that the things upon the earth began to live.
There had been no life at all before, it had all
been dark and cold; it was only when the sun's
beams began to shine upon the cold, dark earth,
that they warmed it into life and love. Now as
first one beautiful thing and then another began
to live upon the earth, the sunbeams admired them
all very much, but they did not envy them, for
there was nothing there <i>quite</i> so beautiful as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
sunbeam. But one day, as they were dancing upon
the waters of the sea, they heard the fishes saying
to each other: &ldquo;How beautiful are the sunbeams!
Is there anything so beautiful as they? Our scales
flash out brightly, but compared to them they are
dull, even on the sunniest day. We should envy
them, were they alive like us, but of course, as it is,
it is different.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are we not alive?&rdquo; said the
sunbeams, and they felt sad and did not dance on
the waves any more that day. Then, another day,
they were dancing on the leaves, and falling through
them on to the shady ground underneath, chequering
it with gold. &ldquo;How glorious are the sunbeams!&rdquo;
said the leaves to each other, &ldquo;more
glorious even than the birds or the butterflies that
perch amongst us. Would that we were as
beautiful!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you envy them?&rdquo; said a butterfly,
who had overheard and felt annoyed; &ldquo;they
have neither sense nor breath, are neither born nor
die. Envy us, if you will, who have all these
advantages, and are so beautiful as well&mdash;much more
so than yourselves&mdash;but do not, however plain you
may be, envy what is not alive.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are we not
alive?&rdquo; said the sunbeams, and they were discontented
and the clouds hid them, so that neither
the trees nor the birds and butterflies within them
seemed to be alive any more. And, again, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
sunbeams were shining through a small window,
where, in a wretched garret, on a still more wretched
bed, lay a man who had care and sorrow&mdash;yes, and
worse even than those&mdash;in his heart. &ldquo;Would that
I were dead!&rdquo; he cried, as he clasped his hands on
his forehead. &ldquo;Ah, how I envy the sunbeams! But
no, I will not envy <i>them</i>, for <i>they</i> are not alive,
they are inanimate merely.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are we not alive?&rdquo;
said the sunbeams; &ldquo;and does nobody envy us
on that account?&rdquo; And the wretched room that
had seemed quite cheerful whilst they were there,
became dark and dismal again, as they withdrew.</p>

<p>And now it was the sunbeams who envied everything&mdash;bird
or beast, or plant or leaf or flower
(even the man in the garret)&mdash;because they were
alive. &ldquo;It is hard that we alone should be without
life,&rdquo; thought they, and they complained to the
sun. &ldquo;Give us life,&rdquo; they cried; &ldquo;we are more
beautiful than anything here on earth, but nothing
envies us because we are not alive. It is dreadful
not to be envied.&rdquo; &ldquo;And do you really think,&rdquo;
said the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span> &ldquo;that you, who have given life to
others, have no life yourselves? Before I sent you
to the earth, it was dark and cold and lifeless. It
needed you, to give it that for which you now ask.
Do not, then, be discontented any more, but be
assured that you have life, as much as anything that
lives and grows upon the earth, though, to be sure,
it is of another kind. Be satisfied, therefore, and rejoice
in your loveliness.&rdquo; This answer of the sun's
satisfied most of the sunbeams, but there were some
who were foolish and whom it did not satisfy.
&ldquo;Give us such life as the children of the earth
enjoy!&rdquo; cried these; &ldquo;the life that breathes and
grows, that has a shape, that is born and dies.
That is the life that we would have. Be good to
us, and give us that.&rdquo; Then the sun said to the
foolish sunbeams: &ldquo;I can give you such life as
you ask for, and, if you persist in asking it, I must;
for you are my children and I cannot bear to see
you unhappy. But remember, if I once grant you
this wish, and give you the life that earth's children
enjoy, you can nevermore be as you now are, or
enter into my palace&mdash;my golden palace&mdash;again.
Now you fly from me to the earth and from the
earth back to me, but when once you have earth's
life, on earth you must remain and on earth you
must die. You are immortal now: when you
become children of the earth you will be mortal as
they are.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>But the foolish sunbeams, who could not understand
what death should be, persisted, and the sun,
who loved them because they were his children, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
to do what they asked. So one night, when all the
other sunbeams had flown back to him, he sent these
foolish ones to sleep on the earth (which had never
happened to them before), and there they lay all night&mdash;some
in the flower-cups, some under the leaves of
the trees&mdash;without giving any light at all, for when a
sunbeam <i>is</i> asleep it can give no light. But in the
morning, when their brother and sister sunbeams flew
back to earth, they woke up, but the two did not
know each other again, for the foolish sunbeams were
not sunbeams any more&mdash;not real ones, that is to say.
They flew about, still, in the forests, and glanced
through the trees, and hovered over the flowers, in
almost the same way as they had done before; but
now they had a shape and wings, and they sipped
the nectar out of the flower-cups, which was a thing
that they had never even dreamed about. They
were Humming-birds, and though their feathers were
as bright as <i>they</i> had ever been, and though they had
all of them long Latin names and a scientific description
in books, still it was not quite the same, for it
would take a lot of Latin and a lot of scientific
description, to make up for not being a sunbeam.
But when the Indians came to know of the occurrence,
they called them &ldquo;living sunbeams,&rdquo; and it is
easy to understand what they meant. And now you
know (until you are a clever person) how Humming-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>birds
came into the world. But you must not think
that the other sunbeams&mdash;the real ones that have
never changed into anything&mdash;are dead. Oh no,
indeed! How could they dance and play about as
they do, if they were?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
Some very Bright Humming-Birds</h2>


<p>One of the most beautiful of all the Humming-birds
(but we can say that of so many) is the
Rainbow Humming-bird. It is very large for a
Humming-bird, so what <i>will</i> you think when I say
that its body is about the size of a little wren's, a
bird which, perhaps, you had been thinking was the
smallest bird there is. Why, a Humming-bird that
is as big, or almost as big, as a wren is a very big
Humming-bird indeed&mdash;in fact quite a gigantic one.
But now, the tail of this Humming-bird is very different
to a wren's, and makes it look still bigger because
it is so long&mdash;three to three and a half inches, I
should think&mdash;and such a wonderful shape. It is
forked, so you must think of a swallow first if you
want to imagine it; but then you must imagine that
the two feathers which make the fork of a swallow's
tail are curved outwards like two little scimitars, so
that their tips are six inches apart from each other.
Indeed they gleam as brightly as any scimitar does in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
the sun, but it is not like steel that they gleam, for
they are of the most lovely deep, rich, violet-blue that
you can imagine, such a colour as was never seen
anywhere else out of the rainbow; and now I come
to think of it, what these lovely feathers are most
like is two little violet rainbows set back to back.
You can think how lovely they look as they go darting
through the air, and I must tell you that the
beautiful violet-blue sends out gleams of other kinds
of blues&mdash;lighter ones&mdash;which are just as beautiful
as the violet itself. On the opposite page you see
the picture of a Humming-bird that is a good deal
like this one. But it is not the same, so the tail is
not <i>quite</i> the same either.</p>

<p>Now of course you will think&mdash;and you will be
quite right to think so&mdash;that a bird that has a tail like
two little violet rainbows will have the other parts of
him beautiful as well. Well, the back of this bird is
all green&mdash;a beautiful, shining, gleaming green, and
his head is green too&mdash;at least it seems to be when
you see it first; but, as you look at it, all at once the
green changes into a heavenly violet blue, to match
the heavenly violet blue of its lovely rainbow tail.
Under the throat it is green like the rest, but just in
the centre of it there is a tiny little drop&mdash;just one
or two little feathers&mdash;of the very loveliest amethyst.
Ah, fancy seeing a bird like that flying about and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
hovering over the flowers. Only you would not <i>see</i>
him, for you would not be able to see his wings&mdash;at
least not properly&mdash;they would move so fast. What
you would see, would be a little circle of hazy brown
mist, and, right in the middle of it, a little sparkling
sun, and on the other side, gleaming through the
mist, two sweet little violet rainbows. Then all at
once there would be a trail of light in the air, and it
would all be somewhere else&mdash;another sun and rainbows
over another flower. Of course, really, a
Humming-bird would have flown from one flower
to another, but what it would look like would be a
gleam of light&mdash;a sunbeam&mdash;with a jewel-flash at
each end of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Illo_131" id="Illo_131"></a>
<img src="images/illo_131.jpg" width="600" height="619" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TRAIN-BEARER HUMMING-BIRD</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another Humming-bird&mdash;the Sappho Comet&mdash;is
about the same size as the last one, and
he is a lovely gleaming green, too&mdash;an emerald
green, I think&mdash;on his head and neck and shoulders,
but his throat is light blue&mdash;the colour of a most
beautiful turquoise. But <i>such</i> a turquoise! There
is no other one in the world that ever gleamed and
flashed and sparkled in that way, because, you know,
turquoises do not sparkle at all&mdash;at least nowhere
else&mdash;it is not their habit. But I think that some of
the very finest of them&mdash;at least the lovely colours
that were in them&mdash;must have flown into that
Humming-bird's throat and begun to gleam and flash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
and sparkle there. Perhaps they begged to be
allowed to as a very special favour. Then the tail
of this Humming-bird is forked too, like the other
one's, but not in quite the same way. It is more
like the fork of an arrow than two little rainbows
turned back to back, and instead of being violet it is
all ruby and copper and topaz, with a broad band
of velvet black at each tip. I cannot tell you how
brilliant those colours are&mdash;the ruby and the copper
and the topaz. They are so brilliant that, if you
were to take them into a dark room, I really almost
think they would light it up like a lamp or a candle.
Oh, it is a wonderful tail. You might think and think
for quite a long time and yet you would never be able
to think how bright&mdash;how wonderfully bright&mdash;it is.</p>

<p>But listen to what the Indians say. They say
that once that Humming-bird was out in a thunderstorm,
and the lightning got angry with him because
he flew so fast, and tried to strike him. It was
jealous of him, that was the reason, for the lightning
likes to think itself faster than anything else. But
although the lightning chased that Humming-bird for
a very long time, it could only just touch his tail,
and there it has stayed&mdash;a little flash of it which was
not enough to hurt&mdash;ever since. You know how
bright the lightning is; that will help you to think
what that Humming-bird's tail is like. And you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
know, now, what his throat is like. Fancy seeing
them both together, flashing, sparkling, gleaming,
beaming, glancing, dancing in the glorious, glowing
sunshine of South America.</p>

<p>But now in the Splendid-breasted Humming-bird
all the glory is upon his breast, his throat. Once, I
think (at least the Indians say so), he must have
flown very high&mdash;yes, right up to heaven, and the
door was open and he tried to fly in. But he could
not, they turned him away; but the glory of heaven
had just fallen upon his breast and he flew back with
it there, to earth. It is green&mdash;that glory&mdash;the most
marvellous, light, gleaming green, but all at once, as
you look at it, it has changed to blue, an exquisite
light, turquoise blue, and then, just as you are going
to cry out, &ldquo;Oh, but it is blue, not green,&rdquo; it is
green again, and then blue again before you can say
that it is green, and then, all at once, it is both at the
same time, for each has changed into the other.</p>

<p>It is the throat-gorget (you know I explained
to you) on which this glorious colour falls, but this
bird has such a large one that it covers the breast as
well as the throat, and goes up quite high on each
side, till it meets the deep, rich, velvety black of the
head. Of course this deep, velvet black makes the
wonderful green and blue look all the more wonderful,
for it is a dark background for them to shine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
out against, and your mother will explain to you
what a background is. Then, on the back this
Humming-bird is green too&mdash;in fact you might call
him the emerald Humming-bird&mdash;but it is darker
than that other green (if anything so bright <i>can</i> be
darker) and without the lovely turquoise-blue in it.
It is a glory, but not <i>such</i> a glory as the one on his
breast; not the glory of heaven that fell upon him at
its gates&mdash;perhaps it is his memory of it as he flew
away.</p>

<p>But now I feel sure you will ask why the same
brightness which streamed out of heaven, and spoilt
the plumage of the Birds of Paradise, should have
made the plumage of this Humming-bird so beautiful.
Well, it is a difficult question, but perhaps it is because
the Humming-bird was thinking of heaven, and wishing
to get into it, whilst the Birds of Paradise had got
tired of being in heaven and were only thinking of
earth. That might have made a very great difference.
And <i>perhaps</i> you will say, &ldquo;If the Humming-birds
are sunbeams that have been changed into birds,
why should some of them have been made more
beautiful afterwards in other ways?&rdquo; Well, as to
that, there are a great many different kinds of Humming-birds
(more than four hundred, as I told you),
so perhaps they were not quite all of them sunbeams
first, and besides, even when a bird has been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
sunbeam first, something else might happen to it
when it had become a bird. At any rate, if one explanation
does not seem satisfactory, there is always
the other, and one of them must be the right one&mdash;until
you are a clever person, which will not be yet
awhile. So now we will go on, for there are some
other Humming-birds with other explanations waiting.</p>

<p>The Glow-glow Humming-bird (I do like that
name) is smaller than any of the other three we have
talked about, for it is less than half the size of a little
wren. Its head and its back are shining green (you will
be thinking all the Humming-birds are green, but wait
a little!), its breast is white, but its throat&mdash;oh, its
throat!&mdash;what is it? What can it be called? It is
a rose that has burst into flame. No, it is a flame
trying to look like a rose. No, it is neither of these.
It is one of those stars that are of all colours, and
change from one to the other as you look at them&mdash;from
green to gold, from gold to topaz, from topaz
to rosy red. Only <i>this</i> star changed into every
colour at once, which was wonderful, and as he did
that (and this was still more wonderful) he flew all
to pieces, and little bits of him were scattered
through the whole air, and when the sun rose and
shone upon them, they were all Humming-birds,
flying about with wings and feathers, and with long
Latin names, so that there should be no doubt about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
it. It was wonderful, wonderful; but yet it was not
quite so wonderful as the colours upon this Humming-bird's
throat.</p>

<p>The Little Flame-bearer (there is a name for
you!) is a still smaller Humming-bird than the last
one&mdash;indeed his body, without the feathers, would not
be <i>very</i> much larger than a <i>very</i> large humble-bee.
Here, again, all the wonder is on its throat, which is
topaz and green and copper, all glowing and sparkling
together, as if they were all married to one another
and each of them was trying to get the upper hand.
Ah, was there ever such a sweet little gem-bird?
He is a jewel mounted on wings and set in the air.
Only sometimes, when he hovers just underneath a
flower, he seems hanging from its tip like a pendant.</p>

<p>Costa's Coquette (that means that some one
named Costa&mdash;some Portuguese gentleman&mdash;was
the first to write about it) is larger than the Little
Flame-bearer (though not half so big as a wren),
and he <i>tries</i> to be brighter. Whether he <i>is</i> brighter
I am sure I can't say. To tell properly, one ought
to see them both hovering under the same flower,
or, at least, very close together, and even then
one would only feel bewildered. But this one's head
and throat are all one splendour, one marvellous
gleam of rosy, pinky, rosy-pink, pinky-rose magenta.
Only if you <i>say</i> that that is what it is, it will change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
into violet and contradict you, and then, if you say
it is violet, it will change into topaz and contradict
you again. So you had better say nothing&mdash;for one
does not want to be contradicted&mdash;but just hold
your breath and watch it. It will change quite soon
enough, even then, long before you are tired of its
rosy, pinky, rosy-pink, pinky-rose magenta, which is
a colour you have not seen, and which I have not
told you about before. Only if you <i>must</i> say something
about it whilst you are looking at it&mdash;something
besides &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I mean&mdash;say it is a Humming-bird.
That will be quite sufficient, and not one of its
colours can be offended with you then for not mentioning
them and mentioning the others. Now, I
must tell you that the feathers of this little bird's
throat&mdash;of that wonderful, gleaming throat-gorget&mdash;grow
out on each side into two little peaks, two
little pointed tongues of rose-pink magenta flame (but
hush!), and he can spread them out and shoot them
forward, as well as the whole of the gorget, in quite
a wonderful way. When he does that, what he <i>seems</i>
to do is to strike a great number of matches at the
same time, and from each one, as he strikes it, there
bursts out hundreds and hundreds of bright, sparkling
jewels of flame. Ah, you should see him strike his
jewel-matches&mdash;all together, all the jewels that there
are, all struck in one second, as he whizzes about in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
the air. His back is all green, and <i>so</i> bright, if only
you cover up his head and throat. If you don't cover
them&mdash;or as soon as you uncover them again&mdash;you
hardly seem to see it. It is no brighter then than a
glow-worm is when a very bright star is shooting
through the air.</p>

<p>Now we come to the Splendid Coquette, a little
bird not half the size of a golden-crested wren, which
is the smallest bird that we, in this country, know
anything about, smaller, even, than the common wren.
<i>He</i> has a crest, too&mdash;this little Humming-bird&mdash;a
very fine one of chestnut feathers, not sticking up on
the top of the head, as so many crests do, but going
backwards after the head has come to an end, so that
it makes a little chestnut feather-awning for the neck
to be under. But just where they spring from the
head each of these chestnut feathers is black, and at
their tips, too, they have all a little black spot, and
this makes them look still prettier than if they were
all chestnut. When the little bird spreads out this
fine crest of his, like a fan&mdash;for he can do that&mdash;all
the feathers in it stand out separately from each other,
and then he looks like a little sun in the centre of
his own rays.</p>

<p>Yes, a sun, because he is so very bright. He has
a gorget (or perhaps you would prefer to call it a
lappet) of feathers on his throat and breast, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
most glorious, radiant green colour, and from it there
shoot out&mdash;one on each side&mdash;a pair of the very
loveliest and most delicate little fairy-wings that ever
you <i>never</i> saw&mdash;for I feel sure that you never <i>have</i>
seen anything at all like them. I do not mean, of
course, that they are real wings, to fly with, no&mdash;it
would be funny if a bird had <i>two</i> pairs of <i>that</i>
kind&mdash;but ornamental ones, wings for the little hen
Humming-bird, who has none, to look at and say,
&ldquo;How beautiful! How <i>extraordinarily</i> becoming!&rdquo;
Each of these dear little wings is made by a few
delicate, long, slender feathers of a light chestnut
colour, the same as the feathers of the crest, only,
instead of being tipped with black, these ones are
tipped with a spot of the same lovely green that
there is on the throat and breast. The longest of
them, which is in the middle, is nearly an inch long&mdash;which
is very long indeed when you think how small
the little birdie is&mdash;and it stands out a quarter of an
inch beyond the two next longest ones on each side
of it, and these are almost a quarter of an inch longer
than the ones that come next. If you hold out your
hand with the fingers spread out, and imagine the
middle one a good deal longer and the little finger
and thumb much shorter, then you will know the
shape of these dear little fairy-wings; only, of course,
feathers are much more elegant than fingers&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
than pretty little fingers. Think how pretty something
in muslin or puff-lace, like that, on a dress
would be!&mdash;but it is ever, oh, <i>ever</i> so much prettier
on a little Humming-bird, in little chestnut feathers
with little green spangles at their tips. And that is
why I call them &ldquo;fairy-wings,&rdquo; for I think if any
pair of wings that are <i>not</i> a fairy's could be pretty
enough <i>for</i> a fairy, those would be the ones.</p>

<p>And I think if you saw this sweet little Humming-bird
hanging in the air, with his breast all
flashing and sparkling, and with his chestnut crest
spread out above it, and his little chestnut and star-spangled
wings flying out on each side of it, you
would think him almost as pretty as a fairy could be.
You would think his fairy-wings the real ones that he
was flying with, because you would see them, whilst
the other ones would be moving so quickly that they
would be only like a mist or haze&mdash;a little night that
he had made for himself for the star of his beauty to
shine in.</p>

<p>Now just try to imagine how lovely that little
Humming-bird must be. Can you understand any
one <i>wanting</i> to kill him? But now that I have told
you about that wretched little demon with his charms
to send people to sleep, and those two bad bottles of
his, or, rather, the powders inside them&mdash;apathy and
vanity&mdash;I daresay you can understand it. If I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
not told you about <i>him</i> I don't think you would have
been able to.</p>

<p>Princess Helen's Coquette (how proud he ought
to be of a name like that!) is a little Humming-bird
something like the last one. He is a
little smaller, I think, but whether he is a little
prettier, too, or not <i>quite</i> so pretty, or only <i>as</i>
pretty, all that I shall leave to you; it is you who
will have to decide. His back is all of a golden
green, and his head, which has a forked crest at the
back of it like a swallow's tail, is a beautiful, rich,
dark, velvety green, so that would make a pretty
little bird&mdash;would it not?&mdash;even without anything
else. But he <i>has</i> something else&mdash;two or three other
things in fact&mdash;which are so&mdash;oh, so <i>very</i> pretty. First,
on each side of the back of the head&mdash;just under
each fork of the little swallow-tailed crest&mdash;there
is a little delicate tuft of feathers, which rise up and
spread out upon each side in such a graceful little
curve. But these feathers are not like other feathers.
They are <i>something</i> like the &ldquo;funny feathers&rdquo; that
the Birds of Paradise have, for they are quite thin,
like threads, and an inch long, which (although it is
not quite so long as those) is yet a good length when
you think of what a little thing this little Humming-bird
is. These pretty little feathers are of a deep
velvety green colour&mdash;the same colour as his swallow-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>tailed
crest&mdash;and there are three on each side, three
little velvet green feather-threads, floating out on
each side behind his head. On his throat there is a
gorget of gleaming, jewelly green, much lighter than
the other greens&mdash;more like emerald, but with a
goldeny, bronzy wash in it, as well. Just think how
beautiful that must be! And then, lower down on
his throat, underneath the green gorget&mdash;as if all that
were not enough for him&mdash;this Humming-bird has
something else&mdash;we will call it a tippet&mdash;which flies out
all round his neck, and, especially, on each side of it.
A tippet or a ruffle&mdash;perhaps that is rather a better
word&mdash;a ruffle of velvet black feathers in front, and
of light chestnut feathers with velvet black stripes&mdash;like
a tiger&mdash;on each side. As for his tail, it spreads
out into a dear little fan, and the fan is chestnut
and black too, broad stripes of chestnut and narrow
stripes of black, with a broad patch of black where it
begins, which looks like the handle of the fan. What
a pretty, pretty bird! Fancy a little birdie that is
only about two inches long, and has a crest like a
swallow-tail on his head, a gorget&mdash;or lappet&mdash;on his
throat, a tippet&mdash;or ruffle&mdash;just underneath the gorget,
and a little spray of feather-threads on each side of
his head, just underneath the crest! Fancy killing
such a little fairy-bird as that! Fancy <i>wanting</i> to
kill him! But it is all the little demon. It is he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
who has blown about his nasty powders and frozen
the hearts of the <i>poor</i> women, who are <i>really</i> so kind&mdash;at
any rate they <i>would</i> be if only he would let
them.</p>

<p>Did I say, &ldquo;Such a little fairy-bird&rdquo;? I think I
did, and I was quite right, for it is just this very
little Humming-bird that the fairies are so fond of
riding on. They go two at a time, sometimes. One
sits on his back, and another lies on the broad fan
of his tail, and the one on the back uses the little
feather-threads as reins. It is so grand! The
Humming-bird dashes up at the fairy's own flower-door,
and hovers there till she is ready to come out,
and then dashes away with her to another flower,
where another fairy lives. And that is how the
fairies call upon each other in countries where there
are Humming-birds. Perhaps you will think that a
Humming-bird&mdash;even quite a little Humming-bird
(and they are none of them big)&mdash;is <i>rather</i> a large
gee-gee for a <i>fairy</i> to ride on. But you must remember
that in tropical countries fairies grow to quite a
remarkable size.</p>

<p>Well, that is eight Humming-birds that I have
tried to describe to you (though it is very like trying
to describe a sunset to some one who has never seen
one), and perhaps you think I have chosen all the
most beautiful ones first, and that there are no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
left which are <i>quite</i> so pretty. But I think I can find
just one more that is not such a <i>very</i> plain bird, not
a bird you would call ugly if you were to see it
hovering about over a bed of geraniums or under a
cluster of honeysuckle, some bright spring or summer
morning when you happened to go out into your
garden. So we will take that one, and, if he is not
pretty enough, you must just try to put up with
him.</p>

<p>He is called the Sun Beauty. Perhaps you
would think him dark at first, for his head and
back and shoulders are of such a rich, deep, velvety
green that it almost goes into black velvet&mdash;all
except one little spot on the forehead, just above
the beak, and that never can look <i>quite</i> black.
Sometimes it does <i>almost</i>, just for one second, but
the next second it flashes into green again, and
oh, how it gleams and sparkles and throws out little
jewels, little splashes of sun-fire all round it!
What a wonderful green it is!&mdash;at first, and then&mdash;oh,
what a wonderful&mdash;but really there is no
proper name for <i>that</i> colour. I was going to say
&ldquo;blue,&rdquo; and perhaps it is more like blue than anything
else, but nothing else is quite like it. Then, just
at the beginning of this Humming-bird's throat&mdash;just
under the chin&mdash;there are a few feathers that
are like a kind of dusky-smoked-magenta-bronze-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>jewelry,
and a little farther down they gleam into
ruddy bronze and coppery topaz, and then&mdash;oh, what
<i>is</i> that? The very sun himself has flashed out from
his throat, from his gorget&mdash;yes, a little flake of the
sun, a sunflake instead of a snowflake. Oh, it is
<i>such</i> a gorget, a gorget of golden topaz, of coppery
gold, of green gold, of silver gold, of silver, of
gleaming white, of all these together, and it spreads
out on each side like a wonderful fan, and shoots out in
front of all the other feathers. Such a gorget! The
feathers in it are not feathers at all&mdash;I do not think
they <i>can</i> be feathers&mdash;they are sunflakes, as I have
told you.</p>

<p>That is what this Humming-bird is like on the
throat. Underneath the throat, on the breast, he
becomes green again, not the dark velvet green of
the back, but a still more glorious green, gleaming
and brilliant, but soft and rich at the same time. It
is a green that changes, too&mdash;changes almost into blue.
I will tell you how that is. Once this green&mdash;this
wonderful, lovely green&mdash;did not think itself lovely
enough (which was funny), so it said to the blue of the
violet and the turquoise and the amethyst and the
sapphire: &ldquo;Come and make part of me, but I must
be the greater part.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is not fair,&rdquo; cried the
blues of all those lovely things;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span> &ldquo;we will come, since
you have invited us, but we intend to have the upper
hand.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; said the green, &ldquo;and let us fight
for the mastery. Whichever wins, the other will be
improved by it. We will struggle together, and we
will see which is the strongest.&rdquo; So they came, those
blues of wonder, from the violet, the turquoise, the
sapphire, and the amethyst&mdash;yes, and from the sky,
the stars, and the sea as well&mdash;and they fell in a
glory on that glorious green that had been there
before them, and fought with it to possess the breast
of that Humming-bird. And they are fighting to
possess it now. They gleam and flash and sparkle
and glow, and try to out-glory each other; but
I think that that wonderful green is the strongest,
although he has such a lot of blues to fight against.
But stronger than any and than all of them is the
sun on that Humming-bird's gorget, that gorget of
gold and topaz, and copper and bronze, and silver and
gleaming white.</p>

<p>That is what that Humming-bird is like, and that
is how he got some of his wonderful colours; so, at
least, the Indians say, only some of them say that it
was the blues who were there first, and asked the
green to come. But always, in history, you will find
that there are different opinions about the same thing.
People are not <i>all</i> agreed, even about the battle of
Waterloo.</p>

<p>So, you see, we have been able to find one other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
handsome Humming-bird, at any rate. And then there
is the Hermit Humming-bird. I must just describe
him. His head and neck are&mdash;brown, the whole of
his back is&mdash;brown, his wings, his throat, and his
breast are&mdash;brown, and all the rest of him is&mdash;brown.
Why, then, he is all brown, without any colours at
all, unless there are some lying asleep, and ready to
wake up and dart out all of a sudden, in the way I
have explained to you. No, there are no colours, either
asleep or awake, or, at any rate, hardly any. Compared
to the Humming-birds I have been telling you
about, this one is just a plain, dull bird, as plain and
as dull, almost, as his wife, for that, you know, is what
the wives of Humming-birds are like. Then is he a
Humming-bird at all? Surely he is not one; he
must be some other bird. Oh no, he is not. He is
a Humming-bird, but he is a Hermit Humming-bird.
I have not told you before&mdash;but now I will tell
you&mdash;that there are some Humming-birds&mdash;in fact a
good many&mdash;that have no bright colours at all, and
<i>they</i> are called hermits. A hermit, you know, is a
person who lives in a cell or cave, and wears a long,
brown gown, with a hood at one end of it for his
head, and never dresses gaily or goes out to see
things, but has what <i>we</i> should consider a very dull
life; only as <i>he</i> likes it that makes it all right&mdash;for
<i>him</i>. So these dull-coloured Humming-birds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
called hermits, not because they live in cells, because,
of course, they do not, but because they have no
bright things to wear, but only brown gowns, like
hermits. But now as Humming-birds used once to
be sunbeams, and are still <i>living</i> sunbeams that have
been changed into birds, how does it happen that any
of them have become hermits, with nothing showy
about them? That is a thing which requires an
explanation, so it is lucky that there is one all ready
for it in the next chapter. Not all the things that
require an explanation are so lucky as that. Some of
them go on requiring one all their lives, and yet
never get what they require. I have known several
of that sort.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
Hermit Humming-Birds and Two Other Ones</h2>


<p>I told you that as soon as the sun's light fell upon
the earth all the sunbeams that had been asleep there
woke up, and were changed into Humming-birds.
But there was just one sunbeam who had gone to
sleep in a cave, and when <i>he</i> woke up it was quite
dark, and so <i>he</i> was changed into a Humming-bird
without any colours, and when his brother Humming-birds
saw him they laughed at him, and called him a
hermit. It was very wrong of them to do so, for it
was not his fault that he was brown. There is
nothing wrong in going to sleep in a cave, and, of
course, he could not tell what would happen. But
they thought he looked ridiculous, coming out of it
all brown, like a hermit. I don't think that made
him ridiculous, really, but, even if it did, they should
not have laughed at him. We should not laugh at
people because they are ridiculous. It makes them
unhappy, and, besides, we may be sure that in some
way or other we are just as ridiculous as they are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
<i>We</i> may not know in what way. <i>That</i> only shows
how ignorant we are. It is best not to laugh at other
people. If we <i>want</i> to laugh at any one, we can
always laugh at ourselves.</p>

<p>Now, this poor Hermit Humming-bird was unhappy
because he alone had no colours, and because
all the other Humming-birds laughed at him. He
complained of it to the sun, who was his father, and
explained how it had happened. &ldquo;It is unfortunate,&rdquo;
said the sun; &ldquo;but since I was unable to shine upon
you, when you awoke, I cannot give you my own
livery to wear now. But do not be unhappy. The
world is full of brightness and beauty, and if you go
about asking for some of it from those who have it,
none of them will refuse you, when they know that
you are one of my children. They will grant it you
for the love of me, for I am loved of all that live
upon the earth. In this way, though I cannot clothe you
directly from myself, it will come to the same thing
in the end, for it is through me that all things have
their beauty, so that in having what was theirs you
will have what is mine, and still you will be a living
sunbeam. Only do not ask any of your brother
Humming-birds to give you anything, because then
you will not be under an obligation to them.&rdquo; (Your
mother will explain to you what being under an obligation
is, and how very many <i>you</i> are under to <i>her</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>So the poor Hermit Humming-bird went about
through the world, asking all the beautiful things in
it for some of their beauty, and not one that he asked
refused him, for the love of his father the sun. He
begged of the clouds at sunset, when they were all
crimson lake, and at sunrise, when they were all topaz
and amber, and all three of these lovely colours fell
upon his throat and struggled for the mastery, like
the green and blue on the breast of that other Humming-bird
that I have told you about. Then he
begged of the bluest stars in the sky, and just on the
outer edge of his now lovely throat, on the edge of
that shining gorget, there fell such a blue as made
one feel in heaven only to look at it. After that he
begged of the sea that the sun was shining on in the
morning, and now his head was of the loveliest pale
sea-green, and then, again, he begged of it a little
later in the day, and his back became a darker green,
almost, if not quite, as lovely as the lovely one on his
head. Thus he went about the world, begging and
asking, and he did not forget either the jewels, or the
flowers, or the colours that live in the rainbow. And
at the end of the day this Humming-bird that had
been all brown, and that his brothers had called a
hermit, was one of the loveliest of all the Humming-birds,
and his English name (we won't trouble about
the Latin one) was the All-glorious Humming-Bird.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
He was not called a hermit any more, after that, but
those Humming-birds that had called him one, and
laughed at him when he was brown, were changed
into hermits themselves. That is how there came to
be Hermit Humming-birds in the world, and one of
them is the one that surprised you so much when I
described him to you, because he was all brown.
They are all of them brown, but you must not laugh
at them, for all that, even though they did at their
brother. They have their punishment, and it is bad
enough to be punished and made all brown, without
being laughed at about it as well.</p>

<p>Now, of course, as all the Hermit Humming-birds
are brown, it would be no use to describe them to
you, one at a time, like the others. Instead of that
I will tell you about some more Humming-birds
who are pretty, and who came to be what they are
like now in some curious way or other, which had
nothing to do with their having once been sunbeams.
One of these is the Snow-cap. He is very small,
almost as small as the smallest of the Humming-birds&mdash;and
you know how small that is&mdash;and although
he is not exactly brown, still he is not at all a brilliant
bird for a Humming-bird. What makes him
so pretty is this. First, all the whole crown of his
head is of a beautiful, pure, silky white, which makes
it look as if a large, soft snowflake had fallen upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
and then, when he spreads out his tail like a fan&mdash;which
you may be sure he knows how to do&mdash;there
are two white patches upon it as well, which look
like two smaller snowflakes. It is not many Humming-birds
who are ornamented in <i>that</i> way. How
did this one get those white patches, and are they
really snowflakes that fell upon him? You shall
hear. Once they were not white at all, those patches,
but coloured with all the colours of the rainbow,
and more brilliant than anything you could possibly
think of, more brilliant even than any other colour
that is upon any other Humming-bird. Indeed they
were <i>so</i> brilliant that no one could look at them, and
that made the Humming-bird very proud indeed.
&ldquo;Could my rivals have looked at me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they
would never have confessed my superiority, however
plainly they must have seen it. Not to be able to
look at me is, in itself, a confession. They are
dazzled, and well they may be, for to look at me is
like looking at the sun himself. Surely there is no
earthly brightness that I do not outshine.&rdquo; And as
the proud bird said this, he looked up, and there, far
above him in the blue dome of the sky, were the
snows of the mighty mountain Chimborazo, and
in their white, dazzling purity they seemed even
brighter than himself. But instead of being humbled,
the Humming-bird only felt insulted, and resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
to do something decisive. &ldquo;I will thaw those white
robes of his,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my brightness shall burn
them away, and there shall be no more snow in
the world.&rdquo; He was just a little larger than a
humble-bee.</p>

<p>So up this Humming-bird flew, right on to the
top of Chimborazo, the great high mountain, where
there was snow everywhere. &ldquo;Have you come to
thaw me?&rdquo; said the snow, as it fell around him.
&ldquo;That is ridiculous. We shall see which of us is best
able to extinguish the other.&rdquo; With that one snowflake
fell upon his head and two more upon his tail,
just over those three patches that had been so marvellously
bright. He tried to shake them off, but
he could not. They stayed there, and instead of
having been able to thaw them, it was <i>they</i> who had
put <i>his</i> brightness quite out. All those wonderful
colours were gone now, and there was only the snow-white.
&ldquo;Fly back,&rdquo; said the snow, &ldquo;or I will quite
cover you. You have lost that of which you were
so proud, but you have me in exchange. Fly back,
and be a wiser bird for the future.&rdquo; So the Humming-bird
flew back, ashamed and crestfallen, and
fearing to show himself. &ldquo;What will the others say
when they see me?&rdquo; he thought. But when the
other Humming-birds saw him, they all cried out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
&ldquo;Oh, look! What beautiful bird is this that has
come to dwell amongst us? What an exquisite
white! Surely he has been to the top of Chimborazo
and brought down some of its snow upon him.
How pure and how lovely!&rdquo; Yes, they could look
at him now, and they thought him more beautiful
than when they were blinded and dazzled. That is
how that Humming-bird got his snow-white patches.
He had no colours now with which to outrival
the other Humming-birds, but he could put up
with that, for the white snow was lovelier than
them all.</p>

<p>And then there is the Humming-bird that the
Indians call the Jewel-flower-sunrise-and-sunset-Humming-bird
(only they have one word for it, which
makes it sound better). I have forgotten what his
English name is&mdash;I am not quite sure if he has
one. This Humming-bird was very beautiful to
begin with, so beautiful, indeed, that the flowers,
as he hovered over them, fell in love with him and
wished to give him their colours to wear, for
their sakes. But the Humming-bird did not
want their colours, for he thought his own were
much more beautiful. &ldquo;If you sparkled like
jewels,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as well as being soft and bright,
then it would be different. But your beauty is
too homely. You are not sufficiently refulgent.&rdquo;
(That was a word he was fond of, for he had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
it applied to himself. Your mother will tell you
what it means).</p>

<p>So the flowers prayed to the sun from whom
they have their beautiful colours, and the sun made
them like jewels&mdash;jewels of the rose and the
violet, of the lily and the daffodil, the sunflower,
the pink and carnation. Perhaps they were not
just the same flowers as those, for they grew
in America, but they had all their colours and
many more. &ldquo;That is an improvement certainly,&rdquo;
said the Humming-bird, when he had looked at
them. &ldquo;You are much more beautiful now, but
you remain the same all day long. It is very
different with the sky. Every morning and evening
when the sun rises and sets, she has quite a
special beauty, and it is only then that she can be
said to be refulgent. If it were so with you, then
I might take you, but I do not care for flowers
who have no sunrise or sunset.&rdquo; So the flowers
prayed to the sun again, and he made them as
much more beautiful when he rose and set at
morning and evening as the sky is then in the east
and west. And when the Humming-bird saw that
they were really refulgent, he took all their colours,
and, for a little while, the flowers were quite pale,
and only got bright again by degrees. But they
never flashed and sparkled like jewels any more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
and there was never another flower sunrise or another
flower sunset. The Humming-bird kept all
that for himself; he never gave any of it back to
the flowers. It was not very generous of him. I
<i>think</i> he was going to be punished for it, but, somehow
or other, it was forgotten. Punishments do
get forgotten, sometimes&mdash;almost as often, perhaps,
as rewards.</p>

<p>Those are just a few of the beautiful Humming-birds
that there are in the world&mdash;in that new world
that Columbus discovered&mdash;but, as you know, there
are more than four hundred different kinds, and
numbers of them are just as beautiful&mdash;some perhaps
even more beautiful&mdash;than those I have told you
about. And you may be sure that they know
exactly what to do with their beauty, how to raise
up their crests and fan out their tails and ruffle out
their gorgets and tippets in the way to make them
look most magnificent, and give the greatest possible
pleasure to their wives, who are all of them hermits&mdash;poor
plain Humming-birds&mdash;just as the Birds of
Paradise do for <i>their</i> wives, who are hermits too.</p>

<p>And do you know that when two gentlemen
Humming-birds are both trying to please the same
lady&mdash;but that, of course, is before she has married
either of them&mdash;they very often fight, and it is then
that they gleam and flash and sparkle, more brilliantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
than at any other time. Ah, what a wonderful
sight that must be to see&mdash;those fights between
little fiery, winged meteors, those jewel-combats in
the air&mdash;diamond and ruby and sapphire and topaz
and emerald and amethyst, all angry with each other,
shooting out sparks at each other, trying to blind
each other, to flash each other down! Ah, those are
fiery battles indeed, and yet when they are over&mdash;you
will think it wonderful&mdash;not one Humming-bird
has been burnt up by another one. No, Humming-birds
do not kill each other, they do not even
hurt each other very much, they are only angry,
and even that does not last very long. <i>We</i> are
not very angry with the poor Humming-birds, I
even think we must be fond of them, for there is
really hardly one that we have not called by some
pretty name, though not nearly so pretty as itself.
And yet we kill them, we take away those bright
little gem-like lives that are so lovely and so happy.
The people who live in those countries make very
fine nets&mdash;as fine and delicate as those that ladies
use for their hair&mdash;and put them over the flowers
or the shrubs that the Humming-birds come to, so
that they get entangled in them and cannot fly
away. Then, when they come and find them, they
kill them (could <i>you</i> kill a living sunbeam?), and
send their skins over here to be put into the hats of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
women whose hearts the wicked little demon has
frozen.</p>

<p>Into hats! Ah, I think if one of those poor,
frozen-hearted women could see a Humming-bird,
sitting alive in its own little fairy nest, she would
blush&mdash;yes, <i>blush</i>&mdash;to think of it in her hat, even
though she wore a pretty one and was pretty, herself,
too. For I must tell you that the nests that
Humming-birds make are so pretty and graceful and
delicate that one might almost think they had been
made by the fairies, and, indeed, the Indians say that
the fairies do make them, and give them to the
Humming-birds. But that is not really true. Humming-birds
make their own nests, like other birds,
though I cannot help thinking that, sometimes, the
fairies must sit in them. Yes, they sit and swing in
them sometimes, I feel sure, in the warm, tropical
nights, when the stars are set thick in the sky and
the fire-flies make stars in the air. For they hang
like little cradles from the tips of the leaves of palm-trees,
or from the ends of long, dangling creepers or
tendrils, or even from the drooping petal of a flower.
They are made of the fine webs of spiders, all plaited
and woven, or of down that is like our thistle-down,
but thicker and softer and silkier. And you may
think of everything that is soft and delicate and
graceful and fragile and fairy-like, but when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
see a Humming-bird's nest, you will think them all
coarse&mdash;yes, <i>coarse</i>&mdash;by comparison. And to think
of that bright little glittering thing, sitting there alive
and warm, in its warm little soft fairy nest, and then
to think of it in a <i>hat</i>&mdash;and <i>dead</i>! Oh, dear!&mdash;dusty
too, I feel sure. <i>Oh</i>, dear! But it is all the fault of
that most wicked little demon, and <i>you</i> are going to
set it right.</p>

<p>Now perhaps you will wonder why there has been
nothing about promising yet, for there have been
thirteen Humming-birds in the two last chapters, and
not a single promise about any of them. But then,
what would be the use of promising about thirteen
when there are four hundred and more? It would be
ever so much better, <i>I</i> think, to promise about all the
four hundred and more together, and that is what I want
you to ask your mother to do. Then all those little
glittering, jewelly, fairy-like things will go on living
and being happy&mdash;will go on glittering and gleaming,
flashing through the air, sparkling amongst the
flowers, sitting and shining in dear little soft swinging
cradles, on the tips of broad, green palm leaves, or
the petals of fair, drooping flowers. They will go on
being <i>living</i> sunbeams then, not poor, dead, dusty
ones in hats. And it will be you who will have done
this, you who will have kept sunbeams alive in the
world, instead of letting them be killed and go out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
it for ever. Yes, it will be you&mdash;and your dear
mother. So now you must say to your dear mother,
&ldquo;Oh, mother, do promise never to wear a hat that
has a Humming-bird in it.&rdquo; Say it quickly, and with
<i>ever</i> so many kisses.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
The Cock-of-the-Rock and the Lyre-Bird</h2>


<p>Well, I have told you about the Humming-birds
and the Birds of Paradise, which are the <i>most</i>
beautiful birds that there are in the world. Now I
will tell you about just a few other ones which are
very beautiful, although they are not quite so beautiful
as those are. One of them is the Cock-of-the-Rock,
a bird which lives in South America, where the
Humming-birds live. There are three kinds and
they are all handsome, but the handsomest, <i>I</i> think,
is the one that is called the Blood-red Cock-of-the-Rock.
It is about the size of a small pigeon, and of
the most wonderful blood-red colour you can imagine.
You would think, when you saw it first, that it had
not one feather on the whole of its body that was not
of this brilliant crimson, but, after a little, when your
eyes are not so dazzled, you see that its wings and
tail are not red but brown. Only, when the wings
are shut they are almost quite covered up by the
flaming feathers of the back, and just on one part&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>that
part which we should call the shoulders&mdash;they
are red too. &ldquo;A scarlet bird! A crimson bird!&rdquo;
that is what you would say first, if you were to see
this wonderful Cock-of-the-Rock, and then, all at
once, you would cry out, &ldquo;Oh, but where is his
beak? Why, he has no beak!&rdquo; Yes, and you might
almost say, &ldquo;Where is his head?&rdquo; for you don't see
that either&mdash;at least, you only see the back of it, all
the rest, and the beak too, is hidden in a wonderful
crest of crimson feathers that almost looks like the
head itself, only it is a little too big for that. This
crest is just the shape of a tea-cosy, so that it looks
as if some one had put a little tea-cosy made of the
most splendid blood-red, fiery, crimson-sunset feathers
right over the bird's head and covered it quite up.
You see no beak at all, and it <i>does</i> look so funny to
see a bird without a beak&mdash;<i>almost</i> as funny as it would
to see a beak without a bird.</p>

<p>The two other kinds of Cock-of-the-Rock are
very handsome birds, too. One of them has all its
plumage orange-coloured, instead of crimson, and
the other is of a colour between orange and crimson.
So, if you were travelling from one part of South
America to another, it would seem as if the same
bird was getting brighter and brighter or darker
and darker all the way, for the three different kinds
do not live in the same parts of the country, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span>
different parts that join each other. Only, of course,
you would have to go in the right direction, which
would be, first, through the forests of British Guiana,
then along the banks of the great river Amazon&mdash;which
is the largest river in the world&mdash;then up the
mountains of Peru, and then, still higher, up those of
Ecuador. Or, you might start from Ecuador and go
all the way to British Guiana. If you get an atlas
and look for the map of South America, your mother
will soon show you where all these places are.</p>

<p>Now after what you know about the Humming-birds
and the Birds of Paradise, you will not be
surprised to hear that this brilliant crimson or
orange-coloured bird has quite a sober-coloured
wife, and that he is as careful to please her, as they
are, by showing her his beautiful bright plumage in
all the ways in which it looks best; in fact he is so
very careful about it that I feel quite sure he pleases
himself by doing so, at the same time. You know
now that male birds dance, when they show their
fine feathers to their wives and sweethearts, for I
have told you about the &ldquo;scalelis&rdquo; of the Great
Bird of Paradise, and the way in which those other
Birds of Paradise danced whilst the two travellers
were watching them. But some birds have still
more wonderful dances than these; at least they
behave in a way that is even more like real dancing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
Now the Cock-of-the-Rock is a very fine dancer
indeed, and he has a regular place to dance and
play in, which we may call his ball-room, or his
drawing-room, or his play-ground&mdash;whichever name
we like best. He chooses it in some part of the
forest where it is a little open, and where the ground
is soft and mossy, and here, every day, a number
of birds assemble, some males and some females;
for of course the hen-birds come too, there would
be nothing to dance for without them. Then first
one of the cocks walks out into the middle of the
open space and begins to dance. He flutters and
waves his wings, moves his head, with its wonderful
crimson tea-cosy, from side to side, and hops about
with the queerest little jumpy steps you ever saw.
As he goes on he gets more and more excited,
springs higher and higher into the air, waves his
wings more and more violently, and shakes his head
as if he were trying to shake off the tea-cosy, so
as to have a cup of tea to refresh himself. All the
other birds stand and look at him, criticise his
performance, turn their heads towards each other,
and make remarks, you may be sure. &ldquo;How
elegant!&rdquo; exclaims a young hen Cock-of-the-Rock.
&ldquo;What spring! What elasticity! Really he is a
very fine performer.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have seen finer ones in
my time,&rdquo; says an older hen&mdash;in fact quite an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
elderly bird. &ldquo;One could judge better, however,
if there were some one else to compare him with.
He seems to be having it all his own way. In <i>my</i>
time there was more emulation amongst male birds.&rdquo;
And you may be sure that, as soon as she says that,
ever so many other Cocks-of-the-Rock step out into
the ring, and there they are, all dancing together,
all springing and jumping, all waving their wings,
and all trying to shake the tea-cosies off their heads,
so as to have a cup of tea for refreshment after all
that exercise. Perhaps you will say that that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
nonsense, because there is no teapot under the tea-cosy;
but remember that no one has ever taken
that tea-cosy off. How can you tell what is under
a tea-cosy until you take it off. (Your mother
will tell you that this is only <i>fun</i>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Illo_168" id="Illo_168"></a>
<img src="images/illo_168.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">COCK-OF-THE-ROCK</p></div>
</div>

<p>But what a strange, curious dance it is, this
wonderful bird dance, all in the wild, lonely forest.
Oh, how interesting it would be to see it&mdash;to find out
one of those little, open places where the moss is all
pressed smooth and firm, and then to hide somewhere
near, and wait there quietly, quietly, without
making a sound, all alone in the great, wild, lonely
forest, until at last&mdash;at last&mdash;there is a crimson flash
amongst the tree-trunks, and then another and another
and another, as bird after bird comes flying or
walking to the ball-room, and the dance begins.
And sometimes you would see them chasing each
other through the forest, all very excited, and often
clinging to the trunks of the trees, and spreading and
ruffling out their lovely plumage, so as to show it to
each other, each one seeming to say, &ldquo;I <i>think</i> mine
is finer than yours; <i>perhaps</i> I may be mistaken, but I
<i>think</i> so.&rdquo; What beautiful birds! and what funny
birds, and what interesting things they do whilst
they are alive! As soon as they are dead they are
not funny or interesting any more, and they are
only beautiful as a shawl or a piece of embroidery is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
beautiful. It is dead beauty then; the beauty of
life&mdash;which is the highest beauty of all&mdash;is gone
out of them.</p>

<p>Now you can see many and many beautiful things
that never had life in them, though some, such as beautiful
statues and pictures, imitate life so marvellously
that you would almost think they were alive. And
you can admire these beautiful things, and take pleasure
in looking at them, without having to feel sorry
that they once were alive and happy, but have been
killed for you to look at. Surely you would not wish a
beautiful, happy bird to be killed, just for you to look
at. You would not even wish it to be put in a cage and
kept alive, in a way in which it could not be happy.
No, you would rather know that it was alive and
happy in its own country, and only imagine what it
was like, and how beautiful it was. That is much
the best way of seeing creatures, if we have no other
way without killing them or putting them in prison&mdash;to
imagine them; and there is ever so much more
pleasure in imagining creatures alive and happy than
in seeing them dead or wretched. It is a very fine
thing, I can tell you, to <i>imagine</i>, and some people can
do it a great deal better than others. There <i>are</i>
people who cannot do it at all, but we do not want
birds killed for <i>stupid</i> persons. People who cannot
imagine can do capitally without seeing, either&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>just
as well as people who <i>can</i> imagine, only in
another way. Now, just ask your mother to promise
not to wear any hat that has the feathers of a
beautiful Cock-of-the-Rock in it.</p>

<p>In Australia&mdash;oh, but perhaps you want to know
why this handsome bird is called the Cock-of-the-Rock,
such a very funny name. Well, although it
lives in forests and flies about amongst the trees, yet
some of these forests are on the sides of mountains,
so, of course, there are rocks all about. The Cock-of-the-Rock
likes to perch upon a very high one; so,
when the old travellers first saw it perched up there,
and looking such a fine bird, they called it a Cock-of-the-Rock,
and almost expected to hear it crow. At
least, if this is not the right explanation, it is the only
one I can think of. The Indians <i>may</i> have another
one, but if they have I cannot tell it you, because I
do not know what it is. Perhaps if I were to think a
little, I should know&mdash;or else I could imagine it&mdash;but
I have no time to think or imagine just at present.
I want to get on.</p>

<p>In Australia, the great island-continent&mdash;the island
that is so large that we call it a continent&mdash;there is a
wonderful bird called the Lyre-bird. It is one of the
most wonderful and the most beautiful birds that
there is in the world, and all its wonder and all its
beauty lies in its tail. This wonderful tail&mdash;as I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
sure you will guess from the name of the bird&mdash;is
shaped like a lyre, though it is much more beautiful
than any lyre ever was, even the one that Apollo
played on. You know, I dare say, what a lyre is, a
kind of harp with a very graceful shape, curving first
out and then in, and then out again on each side, and
with the strings in the centre. Now the Lyre-bird
has, on each side of its tail, two beautiful, broad
feathers that curve in this way, and are of a pretty
chestnut colour, with transparent spaces all the way
down. These are the two outer tail feathers, and they
are like the two sides of the lyre&mdash;the solid part of
it which is held in the hand, and which we call the
framework. Then, for the strings, which, as you
know, are stretched across the hollow space within
the framework, not from side to side, but lengthways
from one end to the other, the Lyre-bird has a number
of most beautiful, thin, graceful feathers, more
graceful and delicate than the strings of any harp.
Only, instead of being straight, like harp strings, these
feathers are curved, and droop over to each side in a
most graceful way, and instead of keeping inside the
two broad feathers&mdash;the sides of the lyre&mdash;they come
a long way past them, and instead of being only
four, which is the number of strings that a lyre has,
there are ever so many of them&mdash;more than a dozen,
I feel sure. And if you could see these feathers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
the way they are made, oh, you would think them
wonderful. You know that on each side of the quill of
most feathers there is what is called the web&mdash;which we
have talked about&mdash;and this web is made of a number
of little, light, delicate sprays, like miniature
feathers, which we call barbs, and these are kept
close together by having a lot of little, tiddy-tiny
hooks (though such soft little things don't look like
hooks a bit), which are called barbules, with which
they catch hold of each other, and won't let each
other go. That is why the web of a feather&mdash;on
each side of the quill&mdash;is so smooth and even. But,
now, in these wonderful feathers of the Lyre-bird,
the little delicate things (the barbs) which make the
webs are much fewer than in ordinary feathers, and
they have no little hooks to catch hold of each other
with, and instead of being all together, they are a
quarter of an inch apart, and wave about, each by
itself, looking like very delicate threads floating from
the long slender quill of the feather. And that, too,
is how those beautiful plume-feathers of the Birds of
Paradise are formed, and you have seen something
like it in the long ones of the peacock's tail. The
tail of the Lyre-bird is not so grand, perhaps, as that
of the peacock, but it is more graceful and delicate,
and on the whole, I <i>think</i> (for on such points one can
never be sure) it is still more wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>But now is it not very strange that any bird
should have a tail like that&mdash;a tail that is shaped like
Apollo's lyre? Well, I will tell you how it happened,
for it is one of those things that requires an explanation&mdash;and
is lucky. Once the great god Apollo (who
is the god of music and song) was walking in Australia
and playing upon his lyre. Now, I must tell
you, at that time&mdash;it was a very long time ago&mdash;the
Lyre-bird had not a tail like it has now, but quite an
ordinary one; so, as it is only its tail that is <i>extra</i>ordinary,
it was quite an ordinary bird. But although
it was ordinary in appearance, it was extremely
musical, as it is now&mdash;I must tell you that&mdash;and also
a wonderful imitator of every sound that can be
made. The Lyre-bird can imitate all the different
notes of other birds, as well as the barking of dogs,
the mewing of cats, and the conversation of people.</p>

<p>So, when it heard Apollo playing so sweetly on
his lyre, it was quite enraptured, and began to imitate
it so cleverly that you would have thought there were
two Apollos playing on two lyres. All the other
birds and creatures were delighted at this&mdash;for, of
course, two good things are better than only one&mdash;but,
for some reason or other which I cannot quite explain,
Apollo was not nearly so pleased. In fact, he became
angry, and <i>so</i> angry that he threw his lyre at the poor
bird who had so appreciated his music, and the lyre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
hit it on the tail as it ran away and cut it right off.
Of course, when the Lyre-bird found that it had no
tail it was in a terrible state, and it came to Apollo
and said: &ldquo;It was because I loved your music that I
tried to imitate it. I failed, no doubt&mdash;for who can
sing as Apollo?&mdash;but still it is a hard price to have
to pay for my admiration.&rdquo; And when Apollo heard
that, he was so sorry for what he had done, and so
pleased with the way in which the Lyre-bird had
explained things, that he said to it: &ldquo;Well, I will
make amends, and what I give shall be better than
what I took away. The lyre which I threw at you, you
shall keep, but it shall be of feathers, and even more
beautiful than my own. You shall not play on it,
for none but myself must do that, but you shall
always be a most musical bird, as you are now, and
able to imitate any sound that you hear, even my
own playing. That power I will not take away from
you, I will even increase it, and from this time forth
you shall be called the Lyre-bird, in honour of your
piety and good taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is how the Lyre-bird got its tail, and
why it is, now, a very beautiful, as well as a very
musical, bird. But what its tail was like before
Apollo gave it the one it has now, that I cannot tell
you, for it has never been known to allude to the
subject, and it would hardly do to ask it. We only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
know that it was quite ordinary. But, do you know,
Apollo never quite liked the Lyre-bird's imitating
him, even though he had told it that it might, and
so, not so very long afterwards, he left the country.
He went to Greece&mdash;it was a very long time ago&mdash;and
he has not gone back to Australia yet.</p>

<p>Now you may be sure that a bird with a tail like
that has his playing ground, where he may come and
show it to his wife or sweetheart; for it is only the
male bird who has it&mdash;like the others&mdash;though, really,
I cannot think what Apollo was about, not to give it
to the hen as well, for he was always a very polite
god. The Lyre-bird's playground is a small, round
hillock&mdash;which he makes all himself&mdash;and there he
will come and walk about, raising his magnificent tail
right up into the air, and spreading it out in the most
beautiful and graceful way. And, as he does this, he
will sing so beautifully, sometimes his own notes,
which are very pretty ones, and sometimes those of
other birds, all of which he can imitate quite well.
But, of course, as Apollo has left Australia, he cannot
imitate him any more now, and after such a long time
he has forgotten what he learnt, unless, indeed, his
own notes are what Apollo used to play. But, if that
is the case, he must have left off singing his old song,
and I do not think he would have done that.</p>

<p>This wonderful bird builds a wonderful nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
with a roof to it, so that he can get right inside it
and be quite hidden from sight, tail and all, although
he is so large&mdash;almost as large as a pheasant, even
without counting his tail. As a rule it is only little
birds that make nests like that, and not big ones.
The Lyre-bird's nest is something like the one that
our little wren makes&mdash;which perhaps you have seen&mdash;only
of course ever so much bigger. Only one
egg is laid in it, and out of it comes one of the
queerest little birds you can imagine, all covered with
white, fluffy down, and with no tail at all that you
can see, so that you would never think he was going
to grow into a Lyre-bird. It takes him four years to
get that wonderful tail. Apollo did not mean him
to have it, until he was quite grown up&mdash;it was not a
thing to be entrusted to children.</p>

<p>Now you must not think that the Lyre-bird
always holds his tail up in the air, for when he walks
through the thick bushes he has to carry it as a
pheasant does, and I think you know how that is. As
soon as he wants to show it to his wife or his sweetheart,
up it goes, and oh, it <i>does</i> look so beautiful!</p>

<p>But now, if it were not for that promise which
your mother is going to make you, there would very
soon be no more of these wonderful birds, with their
wonderful and beautiful tails, left in Australia, which
would mean that there would be none in the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
world, for Australia is the only country in the world
where they are found. People like much better to
see that beautiful tail in their rooms, where it will
soon get spoilt and dusty, or to put some feathers of
it in their hats, than to know that the bird is running
about with it, alive and happy, holding it down like
a pheasant's when he walks through the bushes, but
raising it in the air when he stands on his little
hillock, for the hen Lyre-bird to see, and singing her a
song as well. People who live in Australia&mdash;and there
are a great many people who live there&mdash;might often
see it doing that if they were to take a little trouble
(they take a great deal of trouble to kill it), and, even
if they could not see it, they would hear its beautiful
song. But they like much better to kill it, so that
there may be a little less song and beauty and happiness
in the world, and all because of the wicked little
demon with the correct suit of clothes. But all this
is going to be altered, and you are going to alter it.
Just run to your mother, wherever she is&mdash;if she is
not with you now&mdash;and ask her to promise, <i>ever</i> so
faithfully, never to have anything whatever to do
with a hat that has so much as one single feather of
a Lyre-bird in it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
The Resplendent Trogon and the
Argus Pheasant</h2>


<p>One of the most beautiful birds in the whole world&mdash;more
beautiful, even, than <i>some</i> of the Birds of Paradise
and than <i>some</i> of the Humming-birds, even those
that are not hermits&mdash;is the lovely Trogon of Mexico.
But first I must tell you that there are a great many
birds called Trogons that live in other parts of America
as well as in Mexico, and in other parts of the world
as well as in America. But the most beautiful
of all of them&mdash;which is the only one I shall have
time to tell you about&mdash;is the Resplendent Trogon
or Quezal&mdash;for that is what the Indians call it&mdash;and
it is only found in Mexico, which, you know, is in
North America, only right down at the southern end
of it, where there are a good many Humming-birds
too. There are many more Humming-birds in South
America than in North America. It is the hot,
tropical countries they are so fond of. You see they
like to be with their brothers the sunbeams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>This Mexico is such an interesting country. It
belongs, now, to the Spaniards, whom I dare say you
have heard about, but once it belonged to a quite
different people, an old people who had been there
for hundreds and hundreds of years, long before
Columbus discovered America. These people were
civilised, only in a different way to ourselves. They
did not wear the kind of clothes that we do, but only
light linen things, dyed all sorts of colours, which were
prettier and suited the climate. They had many
cities, as we have, though they were built in a different
way, and the largest was built all over a great lake, with
bridges going from one side of it to another. One
can build houses in the water, you know, for there is
Venice in Italy, and Rotterdam in Holland, which
are both built in the sea, and which your mother will
tell you about.</p>

<p>These people, who were called Aztecs, were very
clever workmen, and such wonderful goldsmiths and
silversmiths, especially, that they used to make imitation
gardens, with all sorts of flowers beaten out of
gold and silver. Then they used feathers as we do a
paint-box, to make pictures of things with. They
would paint houses and ships and men and boats and
landscapes with them, putting the right-coloured
feathers just where they were wanted, blue ones for
the sky, green ones for the grass, and so on. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
wicked little demon knew of those people just as well
as he knows of us, and he had taught them to kill
birds, too. Only as they had no guns they could not
kill nearly so many of them as we can, so that there was
no danger, then, of a beautiful bird getting rarer and
rarer, until, at last, it is not to be found in the world any
more, which is what happens now with us&mdash;at least it
will if <i>you</i> do not stop it. But though it would have
been much better to let these birds&mdash;which were often
Humming-birds&mdash;go on living and flying about, and
though no picture made with their feathers was nearly
so beautiful as the feathers themselves were, growing
upon them, yet these feather-pictures of the old
Aztecs were very wonderful things, and it is a great
pity that there are none of them left now, for us to
look at. Nothing could bring the poor birds back to
life, so we might just as well have had the pictures
that they had helped to make.</p>

<p>And we might have had some other pictures, too, that
these people made, for they used to draw things, just as
we do, and when they wanted to describe a thing they
would often draw a picture of it, instead of only <i>saying</i>
what it was like. Even their writing was all in pictures,
for when they wanted to write&mdash;say the word &ldquo;sun&rdquo; or
the word &ldquo;house&rdquo;&mdash;they would draw a little picture
of the sun or of a house, only so quickly and with
such a few strokes of the pen or the paint-brush (I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
don't quite know which it was), that it was quite like
proper writing. Of course there are some words that
are not so easy to make a picture of&mdash;as you can try
for yourself&mdash;but, wherever it could be done, these
old Aztecs would do it. And if only we had some
more of this writing (for we have very little of it), we
should be able to know a great deal more about this
old people, who were in America before Columbus
came there, and what they did and what they thought
about, and the remarks they made to each other, and
just think how interesting that would be. It is
always interesting to know something about people
quite different to ourselves who lived a long time ago.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when the Spaniards had conquered
these people, instead of keeping the things which they
had made, they burnt them. They burnt their houses,
their temples, their cities, their picture-writings, their
feather-pictures, their wonderful flowers&mdash;until the
gold and silver they were made of were quite melted&mdash;their
clothes, everything&mdash;even the people themselves&mdash;and,
to save time, they often burnt the two
last together. It is a great pity they did this, but,
you see, everybody has a plan of doing things, and
the plan of the Spaniards was to burn the people they
conquered, and everything belonging to them. But
was it not horribly cruel? Oh! most horribly; but
so it is to shoot sea-gulls, and then to cut off their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
wings, before they are dead, and throw them back
into the sea, to drown there or bleed to death. That
is what <i>we</i> do, and <i>it</i> is horribly cruel, too. So do
not let us think about the cruel things the Spaniards
did&mdash;yet. Let us think, first, about the cruel things
that are done by people in our own country, and try
to stop <i>them</i>. <i>When</i> we have stopped them&mdash;<i>all</i> of
them&mdash;then we can think about the Spaniards&mdash;and
some other nations.</p>

<p>You know there is a proverb which says, &ldquo;Those
who live in glass houses should not throw stones;&rdquo;
that is generally one of the first proverbs we learn, and
<i>always</i> the very first one we forget. I am afraid that
those old Aztecs lived in <i>rather</i> a glass house, for <i>they</i>
had a plan of cutting people open, whilst they were
still alive, and tearing their hearts out. Horrible!
was it not? But they did not <i>burn</i> people; so, when
they saw the Spaniards doing so, they were shocked
at them. As for the Spaniards, <i>they</i> were shocked at
the Aztecs doing this other thing, for <i>that</i> had never
been <i>their</i> custom. So the Aztecs and the Spaniards
were shocked at each other. People are very easily
shocked at each other, but they are not nearly so
easily shocked at themselves. Now I come to think
of it, I never remember hearing any one say, &ldquo;I am
<i>shocked</i> at myself!&rdquo; And yet it would often be a
quite sensible remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>But what I wanted to tell you about these old
Aztecs, who lived in Mexico all that time ago, was
that, when the Spaniards came there, they were ruled
over by a great king named Montezuma, and this king,
amongst many other wonderful things, had a great
place, where he kept all the different kinds of birds
that were found in his country. A place like that
is called an aviary, and you may be quite sure that
the beautiful Trogon or Quezal was one of the birds
in King Montezuma's aviary, for it was more highly
thought of than any other bird in the country. Let
us hope that all the birds in this aviary had nice,
large places to be in, with trees, and flowers, and
everything that they wanted; and, as it was a king's
aviary, I daresay they had.</p>

<p>Well, now, I will tell you what this beautiful
bird, the Quezal or Resplendent Trogon, that used
to be in King Montezuma's aviary, is like. It is
about the size of a turtle-dove, but with the most
beautiful, long, curling feathers in its tail, and
these beautiful feathers, and all the feathers on its
back and breast and on its head, too, are of the
most lovely, rich, golden-green colour. Really
I don't know whether there is more of gold or of
green in them, but there is just the right quantity
of each to make them the most beautiful, beautiful
feathers you can possibly imagine. It is the tail-feathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
that are the most beautiful, for they are
so very long&mdash;the two longest are much longer than
those in a pheasant's tail&mdash;but there are some feathers
which begin on the back and lap softly round the
sides, one a little way off from the other, so that you
see their pretty shapes, and these are almost as beautiful,
although they are ever so much shorter. But
now there is something funny about those long
feathers, which I have called the tail-feathers, and
that is, that they are not <i>really</i> tail-feathers at all.
They look as if they were, but <i>really</i> they are
feathers which go <i>over</i> the tail and cover it up,
so that the <i>real</i> tail is underneath them. It is like
that&mdash;though I am sure you never knew it&mdash;with
the peacock; those beautiful, long feathers which
we <i>call</i> the tail are not <i>really</i> the tail, and you
will see that, directly, if you watch a peacock when
he spreads them out, for, as soon as he does, you
will see the real tail underneath, which is nothing
very particular to look at. Still, in both these
birds the long feathers look so like the real tail
that we may very well call them the tail-feathers,
and we can always explain about it afterwards, to
show how much we know. And, do you know,
these beautiful, long, golden-green feathers of the
Quezal, which we are going to call the tail-feathers,
although we know very well they are not, were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
highly valued by these people who used to live
in Mexico, that no one was ever allowed to kill
the bird, but only to catch it and cut them off and
let it go again, so that new ones might grow on it.
And only the chiefs were allowed to wear its
feathers. And, indeed, there would be no great
harm in wearing feathers in hats, if we got them
only in that way. Only I cannot think what the
little demon could have been about in that country. A
law like that must have made him very angry indeed.</p>

<p>Then, besides his splendid tail-feathers, this beautiful
bird has a crest on his head, which is something
like the one the Cock-of-the-Rock has on his, for
it is of the same tea-cosy shape, only it is green
instead of crimson, and it does not quite cover up
the beak. So perhaps you will think that, as the
Cock-of-the-Rock is all blood-red, with a tea-cosy
crest on his head, this beautiful golden-green
Trogon, with the tea-cosy crest on <i>his</i> head, is all
golden-green. But no, all the lower part of him&mdash;that
part which is hidden when he sits down&mdash;instead
of being golden-green, is the most splendid
vermilion, as bright a colour&mdash;although it is not quite
the same&mdash;as the Cock-of-the-Rock's himself. Just
think, golden-green and splendidly bright vermilion!
and you cannot think how beautiful the one looks
against the other. Whether they would look quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
so well together in a dress <i>I</i> am not quite sure,
but your mother would know all about that. Only
you must remember that <i>such</i> a golden-green and
<i>such</i> a vermilion as this Trogon has were never
seen together&mdash;no, or separately either&mdash;in any
dress yet.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE RESPLENDENT TROGON</p></div>
</div>

<p>These beautiful Quezals live in the forests of
Mexico, and they like to sit lazily on the branch
of a tree, and let their beautiful long tails (which
we know are not <i>really</i> tails) hang down underneath
it, like the &ldquo;funny feathers&rdquo; of the Birds of Paradise.
At least the male birds like to do that, because the
female Quezals have not got those beautiful, long
feathers, although they are very fine birds even without
them. They are not so handsome as the males,
but they are not plain like the female Humming-birds
or Birds of Paradise. Perhaps the male Quezals
show off their fine feathers to the females by letting
them hang down like that, because, of course, long,
soft, drooping feathers, such as they have, would
not stand up in the air, like those of the peacock
or of the Lyre-bird. But very likely they have
some other nice way of showing them.</p>

<p>Now, although the Quezal or Resplendent Trogon
is such a magnificent bird, he is not so very often
seen. It is difficult to find him in the dense forest,
and I wish it was still more difficult than it is, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
when he <i>is</i> found, he is always shot for those beautiful
feathers of his. When the Indian who is looking for
him sees him sitting in the way I have told you, he
hides somewhere near and imitates the cry of the
bird. When the poor Trogon hears it, he thinks it is
another Trogon&mdash;a friend of his, perhaps&mdash;and so he
comes flying to where the sound came from. Then
this deceitful man&mdash;and I really think it is <i>very</i> contemptible
to deceive a bird in that way&mdash;shoots him,
and there is one beautiful, happy bird less in the
world. Is it not dreadful to think of, that in almost
every part of the world there are some <i>very</i> beautiful
birds to be found, and everywhere they are being
killed and killed and killed, so that they are getting
scarcer and scarcer every year? If it were not for
what your mother has promised you about the Lyre-bird,
and what she is going to promise you about this
Trogon, there would soon be no more beautiful Lyre-birds
in Australia, and no more beautiful Trogons in
Mexico. How terrible that would be! But we have
saved the beautiful Lyre-bird, and now we are going
to save the beautiful Trogon. Ask your mother&mdash;oh,
<i>do</i> ask her&mdash;to promise, most <i>faithfully</i>, never
to have anything whatever to do with a hat that has
any of the feathers&mdash;short or long, golden-green or
vermilion&mdash;of a Quezal&mdash;a Resplendent Trogon&mdash;in
it. Ah, now she has promised, and we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
saved that beautiful bird as well as a great many
others.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you about a very beautiful pheasant&mdash;the
Argus Pheasant. Some people may think
him the most beautiful one of all. And yet he is
not the most showy pheasant&mdash;for the pheasants, you
know, are very showy birds indeed. There is the
Golden Pheasant, who is dressed in the sun's own
livery; and the Silver Pheasant, who has a silver white
one which is more like the moon's, but who looks
gaudy and smart all the same; and the Amherst
Pheasant, who manages to be handsomer than both
the sun and moon&mdash;which is very clever of him; and
the Fire-back, who is all in a blaze without minding
it at all; and the Impeyan or Monal, who looks as if
he was made of beaten metal, and had just been
polished up with a piece of wash-leather. There is
the Peacock, too&mdash;for he is really nothing but a large
pheasant&mdash;so, you see, the pheasants are a handsome
family, and you may be sure that they know how
to appreciate themselves. The pheasant that we are
going to talk about is quite a large bird, not so large
as the peacock, it is true, but with still longer tail-feathers,
and oh, such wonderful wings! One may
say, indeed, that this bird is all wings and tail, but he
is principally wings, at least when he spreads them
out. But, even when they are folded, they are so very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
large that he looks quite wrapped up in them; and I
think he is, too, partly because of that, but still more
because they are so very handsome.</p>

<p>So, first, I will tell you what these large, handsome
wings of his are like. Well, in each one there are
twenty-five or twenty-six very fine long feathers, but
these feathers are not all so fine or so long as each
other. Ten of them are about a foot long, and these
are prettily marked and mottled with all sorts of
pretty brown colours, whilst, down the centre of each
one, there is a pretty blue stripe. It is the quill of
the feather that makes that stripe, for it is blue, and
looks as if it had been painted. So you see even
these are pretty feathers, but it is the fifteen or sixteen
other ones that are so very beautiful. They are
much broader and longer than the other ten&mdash;the
longest are more than twice as long&mdash;and down
each of them, just on one side of the great quill in
the centre, there is a row of such wonderful spots.
They are as large as horse-chestnuts (big ones I mean),
and what they look like is a cup and ball, the ball
just lying in the cup ready to be sent up; only, of
course, the cup has no handle to it&mdash;you must not
think that&mdash;for the spots are round. And, do you
know, the balls look as if they were <i>really</i> balls, so
that you would think you could take them in your
hand, and throw them up into the air, and catch them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
again as they came down. They do not look flat at
all. You know, when you try to draw an orange or
an apple, how difficult it is not to make it look flat
like a penny. <i>You would</i> make it look flat, I know, but
these wonderful balls on the Argus Pheasant's feathers
look as if they had all been drawn by a very clever
artist (as indeed they have been&mdash;a <i>very</i> clever one),
who had shaded them properly; you know how
difficult shading is. There are eighteen or twenty&mdash;sometimes
as many as twenty-two&mdash;of these
wonderful spots on each feather, but I have not
told you, yet, of what colour they are. Perhaps
you will think they are very bright and dazzling.
No, they are not like that at all. They are soft, not
bright, and their softness is their beauty. All round
them, at the edge, there is a ring of deep, soft brown,
and, just inside the ring, there is a lighter brown, and
it goes on getting lighter and lighter, until, in the
centre, it is a pretty, soft amber, and, at the edge of
the soft amber, there is a pretty, white, silvery light,
as if the moon was just coming out from behind
an amber cloud. <i>So</i> pretty! And when the Argus
Pheasant spreads his wonderful wings out, you can
see more than a hundred of these wonderful spots on
each wing, which is more than two hundred altogether.
Such a sight! so soft and so pretty they
look. Shall I tell you what such wings are like?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>
They are like skies where the stars are all moons,
that float softly among soft brown and amber clouds,
tipping them all with soft silver. For the Argus
Pheasant is not one of the very brilliant birds of the
world. No, he is not brilliant at all. His colours
are only soft browns and soft ambers and soft, silver
whites, and yet he is so pretty, so beautiful. I think
he is as pretty as the peacock, and, when one sees him
after the peacock, it is a rest for the eye. Some
people might prefer him to the peacock. Do you
wonder at that? It is not so very wonderful. There
may be a little girl reading this, with soft brown hair
and soft brown eyes, and with nothing golden or
gleaming about her, and some people, besides her
father and mother, may think her prettier than the
little girl who is all golden and gleaming. It is all a
matter of taste. Some like a broad sheet of water
dancing in the sunlight, and some like quiet streams
running under cool, mossy banks, with trees arching
above them, where the shadows are cool and deep,
and where even the sun's peepings are only like
brighter shadows. People who like that better than
the other, will like the quiet little girl with the brown
hair better than the one who gleams and dazzles; and
they will like the Argus Pheasant better than the
peacock, and think them both a rest for the eye. It
is not at all a bad thing to be a rest for the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
I have told you how large the wings of the Argus
Pheasant are; when he spreads them out to show to
the hen bird (who has nothing like them), they look
like two banners or two beautiful feather-fans, the
kind of fans that you see Eastern queens being fanned
with, in the pictures. Then he has a very fine tail as
well, as I told you. Two of the feathers in it are
very long indeed&mdash;quite four feet long, I should
think&mdash;and as broad as a man's hand, if not broader,
near the base (which means where they begin), but
getting gradually narrower towards the tips. On
one side, these feathers are a soft, rich brown, with
silver-white spots, and, on the other, a soft, silver
grey, with silver-white spots. When the Argus
Pheasant spreads out his two great wings, he takes
care to lift up his fine handsome tail, as well, so that
the two long feathers of it are quite high in the air.
So there is his tail going up like a rocket, whilst his
wings spread out on each side of it, like feather-fans,
and his head comes out between them, just in the
middle, and makes a polite bow to the hen. That is
the right way to do it, and the Argus Pheasant
would rather not do it at all than not do it properly.
Oh, he takes a great deal of trouble about it, and all
for the hen&mdash;which is unselfish.</p>

<p>This beautiful Argus Pheasant lives in Sumatra&mdash;which
is a large island of the Malay Archipelago&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>and
also in the Malay Peninsula and Siam, which are,
both, part of the great Asiatic continent&mdash;as perhaps
you know. Yes, that is where he lives, but you
might walk about there for a very long time, without
ever once seeing him, for the Argus Pheasant is a
very difficult bird to find. He lives in the great,
thick forests, and keeps out of everybody's way.
One hardly ever does find <i>him</i>, but, sometimes, one
finds his drawing-room (for he has one, like the Cock-of-the-Rock
and the Lyre-bird), and if one waits
there long enough (<i>I</i> would wait a week if it were
necessary) one may see him come into it. He spends
almost all his time in looking after this drawing-room,
and he only sees the hen Argus Pheasant when
she comes there too, to look at him. Of course he
dances in it, and it is there that he spreads out his
wonderful wings and lifts up his tail, in the way that
I have told you. The Argus Pheasant is very proud
of his drawing-room, and he <i>will</i> have it nice and
clean, with nothing lying about in it. So, if he finds
anything there that has no business to be there, he
picks it up with his beak, and throws it outside. He
has not to open a door to do that; his drawing-room
is only an open space which he keeps nice and
smooth, so, as it is always open, it does not want a
door to it. Now I think you will say&mdash;and I am
<i>sure</i> your mother will agree with you&mdash;that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>
Argus Pheasant does quite right to act in this way,
and that to keep one's drawing-room clean and tidy
is a very proper thing to do. Your mother may be
surprised, perhaps, that it is the male Argus Pheasant,
and not the hen bird, that does it, but I am sure she
will not blame <i>him</i> on that account. But I am sorry
to say that the wicked little demon has found out a
way of making this habit of the poor bird's&mdash;which
is such a good one&mdash;a means of killing him.</p>

<p>The people who live in that part of the world&mdash;those
yellow people called Malays that I have told
you of&mdash;know all about the ways of the Argus
Pheasant, and how he will <i>not</i> have things lying
about in his drawing-room. Now there is a great
tall reed that grows there, called the bamboo, which I
am sure you have heard of, and which your mother
will tell you all about. The Malays cut off a piece of
this bamboo, about two feet long, and then they
shave it down&mdash;all except about six inches at one end
of it&mdash;till it is almost as thin as writing paper. It
looks like a piece of ribbon then, only, as it is very
hard, as well as thin, its edges are quite sharp, and
able to cut like a razor. But the piece at the end,
which has been left and not shaved down, they cut
into a point, so that it makes a peg, and this peg, that
has a ribbon at the end of it, they stick into the
ground, right in the middle of the Argus Pheasant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
drawing-room. So, when the poor Argus Pheasant
comes into his drawing-room, he sees something lying
on the floor, which has no business to be there. It
may be only a ribbon, but that is not the right place
for it, so he tries to pick it up and throw it outside.
But it won't come, however much he pulls it, for the
peg at the end is fixed in the ground, and he is not
strong enough to pull it out. At last he gets angry
and thinks he will make a great effort. He twists
the long ribbon round and round his neck&mdash;just as
you would twist a piece of string round and round
your hand if you were going to pull it hard&mdash;then
takes hold of it with his beak, just above the
ground, and gives quite a tremendous spring backwards.
You may guess what happens. The long
peg does not come out of the ground, but the
ribbon is drawn quite tight round the poor bird's
own neck, and the sharp edges almost cut his
head off.</p>

<p>Now is not <i>that</i> a most cruel trick to play upon a
bird who only wants to keep his drawing-room in
proper order? How would your dear mother like
to be treated in such a way for being <i>neat</i> and <i>tidy</i>,
which I am sure she is? But we are going to stop it&mdash;this
cruel trick of the wicked little demon&mdash;for it
was he who thought of it and taught it to the Malays.
It is not <i>their</i> fault, you must not be angry with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
any more than with the poor women whose hearts the
same demon has frozen. We are going to stop it,
and you know how. The Malay only kills the poor
Argus Pheasant to sell his feathers. If <i>they</i> were not
wanted he would leave him alone, to be happy and
beautiful, and to dance in a nice tidy drawing-room.
So just ask your mother to promise never to wear a
hat&mdash;or anything else&mdash;that has a feather, or even a
little piece of a feather, of an Argus Pheasant in it.</p>

<p>That was going to be the end of the chapter, but
there is just something which I have forgotten. I
am sure you will have been wondering why this
beautiful pheasant is called the Argus Pheasant, and
what the word Argus means. Well, I will give you
an explanation. Argus was the name of a wonderful
being&mdash;a kind of monster&mdash;who had a hundred eyes,
and who lived a long time ago. But he offended the
great god Jupiter, who had him killed, and then
Jupiter's wife&mdash;the goddess Juno&mdash;whose servant he
was, put all his eyes into the tail of the peacock&mdash;for
the peacock was her favourite bird. That is one
story; but another one says that she did <i>not</i> put them
<i>all</i> there, but only the bright ones. The soft ones&mdash;those
pretty ones that I have been telling you about&mdash;she
put into the wings of another bird, that she liked
quite as well, if not better, and that bird became, at
once, the Argus Pheasant. But now if Argus had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
only a hundred eyes, how is it that there are two
hundred, or more, in the wings of the Argus Pheasant,
to say nothing of those in the tail of the peacock?
That shows, <i>I</i> think, quite clearly that he must, really,
have had a great many more; and so, now, when
people talk to you of Argus and his hundred eyes,
you can say, &ldquo;A hundred, indeed! Why, he must
have had <i>three</i> hundred at the very least.&rdquo; And
then you can tell them why.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
White Egrets, &ldquo;Ospreys,&rdquo; and Ostrich-Feathers</h2>


<p>The last bird I am going to tell you about is
the White Egret. But, do you know, I am not
quite sure if he is beautiful enough to be put in a
book of beautiful birds, because, of course, a book of
beautiful birds means a book of <i>the</i> most beautiful
birds that there are, and I am not <i>quite</i> sure if the
White Egret is so beautiful as all that. At any rate
he is not so beautiful as the birds I have been telling
you about, and there are many other birds in the
world that I have <i>not</i> told you about, that are more
beautiful than he is. So, perhaps, you will wonder
why I put him into the book at all, but I will soon
give you a proper explanation of it. In the first
place, if the White Egret is not one of the most
beautiful birds in the world, yet, at any rate, he has
some of the most beautiful feathers that any bird has,
and that alone, I think, gives him a right to be here,
because, you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span> &ldquo;fine feathers make fine birds.&rdquo;
And, in the second place, this poor bird is so shot
and killed and persecuted for these beautiful feathers
of his, that, unless you were to get your mother to
make that promise about him, there would soon be
no such thing as a White Egret left in the world.
He and his feathers would both be gone.</p>

<p>But now, perhaps, you will say that if &ldquo;fine
feathers make fine birds,&rdquo; then beautiful feathers
must make beautiful birds, too, and so the White
Egret must be a beautiful bird. Oh, yes, he is.
You are quite right. I did not mean that he was not
a beautiful bird at all. All I meant was that he was
not quite so beautiful as the Birds of Paradise and
the Humming-birds, and birds like that&mdash;birds that
look as if they had flown into a jeweller's shop, and
then flown out again with all the best part of the
jewellery upon them. Whether he is not as beautiful
as some of the other birds we have talked about&mdash;but
I will not say which, for fear of offending
them&mdash;that I am not quite so sure of; but, at any
rate, he is beautiful.</p>

<img src="images/illo_205.jpg" width="600" height="658" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE WHITE EGRET</p></div>
</div>

<p>Oh, yes, he is quite a beautiful bird, is the White
Egret; and now I will describe him to you. I shall
not have any colours to tell you about, because he is
all white&mdash;which of course you will have guessed
from his name&mdash;but you know how beautiful white
can be. You will not have forgotten the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
Humming-bird who was made still more beautiful
than he had been before, by three snowflakes falling
upon him. But, with this bird, it is as if the snow
had fallen all over him and covered him up, for he is
white all over, a beautiful, soft, silky white, as pure
and delicate as the snow itself. Only his shape,
perhaps, is a little funny&mdash;at least you might think
so&mdash;for he has a pair of long, thin, stilty legs, and a
long, thin, snaky neck, and a long, sharp, pointed
beak, so that all three of these together make him a
tall, thin, stilty bird. &ldquo;Something like a stork, that
is,&rdquo; you will say, for you will have seen pictures of
storks, even if you have not seen one alive in the
Zoological Gardens&mdash;which is a very bad place for
him, <i>I</i> think. Well, this bird <i>is</i> something like a
stork, but he is a great deal more like a heron, that
long-legged, long-necked bird that stands for hours
in the water, waiting for a fish to come near it, so that
it may catch it and swallow it; for the heron, you
know, lives on fish and frogs, and things of that
sort.</p>

<p>Yes, he is very like a heron, and, do you know,
there is a very good reason for that, because the
White Egret <i>is</i> a heron. Some birds, I must tell
you, have names which are like our surnames, and
show the family they belong to. As long as you
only know a boy's or girl's Christian name&mdash;Reginald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
or Bertram or Dorothy or Norah or Wilhelmina&mdash;you
don't know a bit what family they belong to;
but as soon as you know their <i>surnames</i>&mdash;Smith or
Brown or Jones or Thompson or Robinson&mdash;why then
you do&mdash;and it is just the same with birds. Heron
is really a surname, only the bird that has it, here in
England, has not a Christian name as well&mdash;unless
&ldquo;common&rdquo; is one, for he is called the Common
Heron. But White Egret is a Christian name and
the surname to it is Heron&mdash;for the White Egret
belongs to the Heron family. That is why he is so
tall and gaunt and stilty, for a heron is always like
that&mdash;it is the family figure&mdash;and so now, when I tell
you that <i>he</i> stands in the water and catches fish, you will
know why he does that, too; fish is the family dish, and
no heron would think of going without it, for long.</p>

<p>But now, let me tell you about those beautiful
feathers which the poor White Egret has. They
grow only on his back&mdash;about the middle of it&mdash;and
droop down to a little way over his tail, so that
they are a foot or more long. You remember what
I explained to you about the feathers in the tail
of the Lyre-bird, and those that make the plumes in
the beautiful Birds of Paradise&mdash;how the barbs of
the feather on each side of the quill have no
barbules to hold them together, so that they fall
apart and wave about like beautiful, soft, silky threads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
If you have forgotten, then you must look back for
it, because I should not explain it better here than I do
there, and, besides, it would be twice over. Well,
these feathers are made in the same way, only they
are of a pure, shining white&mdash;like all the rest of this
birds plumage&mdash;and although they are as soft as silk
they are stiff at the same time, and so smooth that
they look like the delicate flakings from a piece of
beautiful, pure, polished ivory. Imagine a little
fountain of ivory threads all shooting up together
into the air, quite straight at first, and then bending
over and drooping down in the most delicate, graceful
way imaginable. That is what a plume of those
feathers looks like, when they have been taken out and
tied together, but I wish, myself, that they did not
look nearly so beautiful, for it is because of those beautiful
plumes, that the poor bird is being killed and killed
and becoming scarcer and scarcer, every day. For the
women whose hearts the little demon has frozen, wear
these plumes in their hats and in their hair, and they
are called &ldquo;ospreys,&rdquo; and are very fashionable indeed.</p>

<p>Soldiers, too, used to wear them in their caps,
but <i>they</i> have given up doing so. It is only the
frozen-hearted women who are killing the poor
White Egrets now&mdash;but ah, there are so many of
them (the women I mean, not the Egrets). I have
sat at the entrance of a large concert-hall, and counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
the faces that had these lovely egret-plumes&mdash;these
beautiful, fashionable &ldquo;ospreys,&rdquo; so white and yet so
blood-stained&mdash;nodding above them&mdash;counted them
as they came in and as they went out, young faces,
old faces, soft faces, hard faces, shrivelled faces,
puckered faces, painted faces, plain faces, ugly faces,
quite dreadful faces&mdash;ah, what numbers of them
there were! It was quite difficult to count them all.
Every now and again there would be a pretty face, and
I used to count <i>those</i> separately&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;sometimes
up to half-a-dozen. That was
not so tiring, but, you see, I had to count them all.</p>

<p>Oh, wise but wicked little demon, who blew his
bad powders into the hearts of <i>all</i> the women!
There were two kinds, you know, and one of them
was &ldquo;Vanity.&rdquo; Now if it had been a man&mdash;however
wicked a one&mdash;I feel sure that he would have
looked about for the women with the <i>pretty</i> faces,
and who were rather young, to blow <i>that</i> powder
into. But the little demon was wiser, in his own
wicked way. He did not go about, looking and
looking. He blew it into <i>all</i> their hearts, and that
gave him no trouble at all.</p>

<p>Now, I must tell you that there are two different
kinds of White Egrets, with these beautiful feathers
that the women with the frozen hearts wear. One
is much larger than the other, and is called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
Great White Egret. He is quite a big bird, larger
even than our common heron&mdash;and you know what
a big bird <i>he</i> is. The other one, which is called
the Small White Egret, is not more than half the
size of the great one, but his feathers are the most
beautiful, so that, though he has not nearly so many
of them, he is worth nearly twice as much money.
That means, of course, that the servants of the
wicked little demon, who shoot him and sell his
feathers, can get nearly twice as much money for
them as they can for the feathers of the other one.
So, of course, they like shooting him best, but they
are very glad to shoot the other one&mdash;the Great
White Egret&mdash;too, for even <i>his</i> feathers are worth
a good deal. Now, if the wicked little demon had
not frozen the hearts of women, they would never
want to wear feathers that cost the lives of the poor
birds to whom they belong&mdash;because, you know, women
are, <i>really</i>, so kind. Then, of course, those feathers
that are so beautiful would not be worth anything
(as it is called), and so men would not shoot the
White Egrets, because they would not be able to
sell their feathers. I am afraid they would have
no better reason for not doing so than that, because
men, you know, are not kind and pitiful&mdash;as women
are, if only their hearts are not frozen. But, at
any rate, the White Egrets would be left alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>And you must not think that their feathers would
<i>really</i> not be worth anything, then. When we talk
of a thing not being worth anything, what we really
mean is that we cannot sell it for money. Now what
are things that you cannot sell for money? I will
tell you three. There is the sky, and the air, and
the sunlight. You cannot buy or sell them, but do
you think they are not worth anything! <i>I</i> think
they are worth a good deal. Then there is a good
temper; nobody can buy that, but yet what a lot
it is worth! Now if the beautiful feathers of the
White Egret could not be sold, because the world
was better and there were no frozen-hearted women
to buy them, yet they would be worth something,
although it would not be money. They would be
worth love and pity and sympathy and interest
and real admiration (which never wants to kill),
for all those things would be given to the beautiful
bird with its beautiful feathers, and it would
be just because of those things that no one would
think of killing him. His feathers, then, would
be like the smiles on a face. You cannot take
those <i>out</i> of the face, and put them in a hat. If
you could, then some one would soon say to you:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>
&ldquo;Will you part with a few of your smiles? They
are fashionable in hats just now; I will give you,
for a nice, bright one&mdash;let me see&mdash;half-a-crown.&rdquo;
Then you might say that a nice, bright smile was
worth half-a-crown. But I think it is worth much
more where it is, in your face, though you cannot
take it out and get half-a-crown for it.</p>

<p>Smiles are not bought for money in <i>that</i> way, but
you must remember that what is not worth money
is often worth much better things. That is why
I wish the feathers of the poor White Egrets were
not worth even a penny. If they were not, then,
if you were to go to the countries where they live,
you would see those feathers on the birds themselves,
where they look most beautiful, and you could watch
the birds (with the feathers on them) flying through
the air, or perched in trees, or walking about in the
water and catching fish in it, or building their nests, or
feeding their young, or doing all sorts of other interesting
and amusing things. And they would not be
so rare then; in fact they would be quite common,
so that you would not have to go into such out-of-the-way
places&mdash;yes, and such unhealthy places too&mdash;in
order to see them. No, they would be all about,
so that they would often come to see <i>you</i>, instead of
your going to see <i>them</i>; sometimes, even, they might
come into your garden&mdash;for why should you not
have a garden in another country?&mdash;and walk about
on the lawn. Think how interesting that would
be, and how pretty it would look!&mdash;and all because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
those beautiful white feathers would not be worth
anything.</p>

<p>But, because they are worth a good deal, men who
would kill every bird in the world for money go out
with guns, and shoot these poor White Egrets whenever
and wherever they see them. And, because of this, they
are only to be found, now, in swamps and places where
you, and most other sensible people, do not like to
go; so that, now, the only people who ever see these
beautiful birds are just the servants of the demon,
who murder them as soon as they see them. You
and I, and others like us, who would like to look at
them, and admire them, and watch their ways, and
learn all about them, cannot do so, cannot see
them at all, cannot even imagine them, unless in
swamps, and being shot. Yet once they were
quite common, so that everybody might look at
them. Now they are getting rarer and rarer, so that
very soon, if we do not do something about it quickly,
there will be no more of them left in the world. How
dreadful that is to think of! If you were to see a
very beautiful picture, or statue, and then, afterwards,
you were to hear that it had been destroyed, you
would feel sorry, would you not? And not only
you, but all the world would. I feel perfectly sure
that if Sir Edwin Landseer, who (as your mother
will tell you) was a great animal artist, had painted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
White Egret, everybody would think it quite shocking
if it were to be burnt or torn up. You would
hear people say (and they would be quite right to say
so): &ldquo;Oh, it is dreadful, it is quite dreadful to think
of! It can never be replaced! There is no such
other artist! To think of such a masterpiece being
destroyed!&rdquo; Now, when all the White Egrets (and
let me tell you they are <i>all</i> masterpieces) have been
destroyed, it will be quite impossible to replace any
one of them; so that that kind of bird&mdash;or any other
kind of bird or animal that has been shot and shot
till there are no more of it left&mdash;will have gone
in just the same way that a picture goes, when you
burn it or tear it to pieces. But is there any picture
of a bird or animal, that is so beautiful or so wonderful
as that bird or animal itself? And is there any
artist so great as the artist who made it, who made
that bird or animal, that picture with a life inside it?
You know who <i>that</i> artist is, you know <i>His</i> name&mdash;or
if you do not, your mother will tell you. I have
called Him Dame Nature, but that is only just a way
of talking. He has another name, greater than that.
He is a much greater artist than Sir Edwin Landseer
(or even Raphael or Phidias), but I am afraid there
are not many people who really know that He is.
Perhaps He is too great to be appreciated. That
sometimes happens, even amongst ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>Well, these poor White Egrets&mdash;these masterpieces
that are always being destroyed&mdash;are birds that live,
mostly, in America&mdash;in Mexico, and California, and
Florida, and, I think, all over South and Central
America. They live in the swamps and lagunes&mdash;as
they are called&mdash;of the great forests, where
trees grow all about in the water&mdash;such dark,
gloomy, wonderful places&mdash;and the servants of the
little demon, whose business it is to kill them,
have to follow them to those places, and live there,
too. Of course it is very unhealthy for them, and
they often die there; but the women with the frozen
hearts do not mind that, any more than they mind
the Egrets being shot. They want the feathers, and
when they pay for the feathers they pay for the lives
as well&mdash;for they are honest, although their hearts
have been frozen.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will wonder how men can live at all,
in such places as those. Of course, as it is all water,
they have to live in boats or canoes, and as soon as
they have found out a pool or creek, where the White
Egrets come to catch fish, or some trees where they
have built their nests, they cover their boats over
with reeds or rushes or ferns or the branches of trees,
so that, even though you were to come quite close to
them, you would not think they were boats at all,
but only part of the forest. That is what the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
White Egrets think, for the men sit in their covered-up
boats, quite silently&mdash;without speaking a word&mdash;and,
as soon as they come near enough to them, fire
at them and kill them.</p>

<p>And now I will tell you another dreadful thing,
which makes the killing of these poor birds more
cruel even than you will have thought it was, though
I am sure you will have thought it cruel enough. I
have spoken of their having nests, so, of course, there
will often be young ones in those nests, who cannot
feed themselves, but have to be fed by the parent
birds. What do the young ones do when the parent
birds&mdash;their own fathers and mothers&mdash;have been
shot? I will tell you. They starve. That is what
they do, and that is what the women with the frozen
hearts, who wear these feathers, know that they do&mdash;for
they have been told so, now, often enough. Is
it not terrible? For those pure, white, beautiful
feathers, not only have the grown birds been killed,
but the young ones&mdash;their children&mdash;have starved&mdash;starved
slowly&mdash;in the nest where they were born.
Day after day they had looked out from it, to see
their father or mother come flying to them, with
something to eat; day after day they had not seen
them, and when the night came&mdash;oh, they were so
hungry! Before, how glad they used to be when
they saw the great, white wings come floating to them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>
slowly, through the air, like a silver sun, like a broad,
white, silken sail. Nearer and nearer they came, and
then there was a cry of greeting, and such <i>good</i> appetites
for breakfast or dinner. Their appetites were
just as good now&mdash;indeed better, for they were starving&mdash;but
where was father or mother, where were the
broad, white wings, the silken sail, the great silver
sun? Oh, how they strained their eyes and stretched
their poor, little, long necks over the side of the nest,
to try to see them, to see if they were not coming, if
there was only a speck of white in the distance!
But they saw nothing, for father and mother had
both been shot. And, now, they grew so weak with
hunger that they could not hold their heads up, any
more. They laid them down in the nest, and their eyes
closed, and their poor little voices only came in whispers,
&ldquo;Feed us! feed us!&rdquo;&mdash;they had been screams
before. Then even the whispers ceased, the beaks
could not be opened, and slowly, slowly they starved.</p>

<p>And those are the feathers&mdash;feathers that have
been got in that way&mdash;which the poor women whose
hearts the little demon has frozen, wear in their hats.
In those hats they go out to concerts, and hear songs
that are all of love and tenderness, and music that
seems to have been made by the angels in heaven; in
those hats they go to meetings that are held, perhaps,
for some good and just thing&mdash;to save people from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
being killed, or children from being starved&mdash;some of
them may even speak at such meetings&mdash;and in those
hats, those very hats; in those hats, too, they go to
church, they kneel down in them, and they pray&mdash;yes,
<i>pray</i>.</p>

<p>Oh, it is wonderful&mdash;wonderful! In Africa, where
the people believe in witchcraft, one man will throw
a spell upon another man that he hates, so that wherever
that man goes and whatever he does, he always
sees his face, his enemy's face. There it is, always
before him, and, at last, he gets so tired of seeing it
that he dies, or even kills himself. Of course, he
does not <i>really</i> see the face, and his enemy does not
<i>really</i> cast a spell upon him, because there is no such
thing as witchcraft, <i>really</i>; it is all superstition, as I
think you know. But as the one man <i>thinks</i> he sees
the face, and the other man <i>thinks</i> he is casting a
spell upon him, and making him see it, it comes to
very nearly&mdash;if not quite&mdash;the same thing as if it
were real, especially as the one man does <i>really</i> die.
Ah, if those hats could cast a spell (not quite the
same one as that, but something like it), if, wherever
the women who wore them went&mdash;whether it was to
concerts where they heard beautiful music, or to
meetings where good things were talked about, or
to church where they kneeled down and prayed&mdash;they
always saw a picture of a nest, with young birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
in it, starving&mdash;slowly starving! if it was always
there, always before them&mdash;that pitiful picture&mdash;and
if the voices came, too&mdash;the screams, and then the
whispers&mdash;&ldquo;Feed us! feed us!&rdquo; then, I think,
they would take off those hats, and they would not
wear them any more. They need not die or kill
themselves, they would only have to take off those hats.</p>

<p>And they will do that now, because you and
every little child in the world will have asked them
to. Yes, they will do it now. They will take off
those hats&mdash;those hats of starvation and murder, of
terrible and shameful cruelty&mdash;they will leave off
wearing them, they will never put them on, again.
Those plumes called &ldquo;ospreys,&rdquo; that one sees everywhere&mdash;in
streets and in shop-windows, at concerts,
at meetings, and in churches&mdash;that bend above fine
sentiments, that wave over charities and goodnesses,
and tremble, softly, in the breath that prayers are
made of&mdash;they will tear them out of their hats and
out of their hair&mdash;yes, and out of their hearts too.
They will hate them, they will loathe them, and
when they say, next time, in church, upon their knees,
&ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread,&rdquo; they will try not
to remember them, or only to think that they are
unfashionable.</p>

<p>Oh, make them unfashionable! for you have not
yet, you have not said &ldquo;promise&rdquo; yet. Oh, then, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
once, at once! Break the spell of the demon, that
spell that is so real and so cruel, that spell that kills
the soul. Thaw the poor frozen heart, thaw it with
your own warm one, with your lips, with your soft
hands and arms. Thaw it with the tears in your eyes,
as they look up, thaw it with the words that you
say, &ldquo;Mother, do not kill parents, and make children
starve! Mother, do not wear &lsquo;ospreys!&rsquo; Oh,
mother, promise, promise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, now, we have saved the White Egrets, as well as
all those other birds that I have been telling you of,
and that your mother has promised about. But does
that save all the beautiful birds in the world? Oh
no, for there are ever so many more than I have been
able to say anything about, in a little book like this,
more&mdash;oh, a great many more&mdash;than all the Birds of
Paradise, and all the Humming-birds, and all the other
ones in the other chapters&mdash;for, you know, there are
not many&mdash;put together. And though the Humming-birds
and the Birds of Paradise and the White
Egrets and the others are, now, quite safe, yet, if your
mother does not promise about the rest, people will
go on killing them, till there are no more of them
left in the world. Think what that would mean!
Why, besides hundreds and hundreds of beautiful
foreign birds, it would mean all the kingfishers&mdash;the
star-birds (for there has been no promise about them)&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>and
all the chaffinches and bullfinches and goldfinches
and greenfinches&mdash;yes, and all the little robin-redbreasts
too&mdash;being shot and shot, killed and killed,
till there were no more of them left, either in England
or anywhere else. For, of course, when all the beautiful
foreign birds were gone, then the frozen-hearted
women would begin to wear our own little birds, here
at home, in their hats. You would hear one lady say
to another: &ldquo;I wanted to have a redbreast tippet
this winter, but, my <i>dear</i> they are so expensive.
You see, hundreds go to one, because there's only
the breast, so I'm afraid I must fall back on
greenfinch. They're less, of course; you see, there's
a greater surface, and they're not quite so rare.
But I <i>did</i> so want redbreast!&rdquo; And, then, the other
lady would say: &ldquo;Well, I think I should manage
it if I were you, dear, for, you know, they say there'll
soon be no more real redbreast&mdash;only imitation.
So it's best to get one, whilst there's time.&rdquo; And
you may be sure that it would be managed somehow&mdash;things
like that always are.</p>

<p>Well, then, but what is to be done? Do you
think your mother would make a promise about all
the birds? I think she would if <i>you</i> were to ask
her. But then, perhaps, she might think it a <i>little</i>
hard not to wear any feathers&mdash;just at first, at any
rate&mdash;although flowers and all sorts of other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
look ever so much nicer in hats. Oh, but wait.
Are there <i>no</i> feathers that can be worn in hats
without its doing any harm at all&mdash;without any bird
being killed to get them? Why, yes, of course
there are&mdash;and the very handsomest of them all&mdash;ostrich-feathers.
Ostriches are kept on farms, and
twice a year, their beautiful white and black feathers
are clipped and sent to the market. So, as they are
not killed, but kept alive and fed and taken care of,
and have a very good time of it&mdash;as I can tell you
that they do, for I have lived on an ostrich-farm&mdash;I
do not see any reason why one should not wear
their feathers&mdash;if one wants to. And how beautiful
their feathers are! I think, myself, that they are the
only feathers that really look nice in a hat&mdash;at any
rate they are the only ones that ever looked nice in
a portrait. A portrait of a lady in a beautiful,
broad-brimmed hat, with beautiful, broad, soft ostrich-feathers
curling all round it, looks lovely; but a
portrait of a lady in a stiff little pork-pie sort of
thing, with a lot of heads and wings and tails, sticking
bolt upright in it, looks <i>horrid</i>. People, you know,
always look like their portraits, as long as their
portraits are good ones&mdash;and, of course, we are not
talking about bad portraits. So I think that any
<i>sensible</i> woman, even though her heart were frozen
and she were determined to wear feathers, would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
wear ostrich-feathers. Of course, no woman whose
heart the wicked little demon had <i>not</i> frozen would
ever wear any other kind.</p>

<p>But there are not going to be frozen-hearted
women in the world any more, now, because their
little children will soon have thawed all their hearts,
and the Goddess of pity is just beginning to wake
up again. So now, ask your dear, dear mother to
make just one more promise, just one more which
will be better than all the others she has made.
Of course she could not be expected to make it
quite at first, but now, after all that you have told
her, I think she will. Just go to her and throw
your arms round her neck, and whisper: &ldquo;Mother,
promise not to wear <i>any</i> feathers, except the beautiful
ostrich-feathers that you look so <i>lovely</i> in.&rdquo; As
soon as she has promised, then all the beautiful
birds in the world (and that means all the birds,
for all birds are beautiful) will be saved, and it is
you and the other little children who will have saved
them. So, of course, you must keep on saying
&ldquo;Promise&rdquo; till she does.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
